He had extremely\\nlimited family ties. Both of his daughters had moved out of the\\ncountry, and did not maintain much contact, and he had no other\\nrelatives except a father and sister from whom he was estranged. His\\nwife and the mother of his children had passed away years ago, and\\nthe sole relationship he endeavored to establish while he saw me\\nover the course of more than a decade and a half terminated\\ntragically when his new partner was killed in an automobile accident.\\n\\nWhen we began to work together, our conversations were\\n\\ndecidedly awkward. He was not accustomed to the subtleties of social\\ninteraction, so his behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, lacked the dance-\\nlike rhythm and harmony that characterize the socially fluent. As a\\nchild, he had been thoroughly ignored as well as actively discouraged\\nby both parents. His father—mostly absent—was neglectful and\\nsadistic in his inclinations, while his mother was chronically\\nalcoholic. He had also been consistently tormented and harassed at\\nschool, and had not chanced upon a teacher in all his years of\\neducation who paid him any genuine attention. These experiences\\nleft my client with a proclivity toward depression, or at least\\nworsened what might have been a biological tendency in that\\ndirection. He was, in consequence, abrupt, irritable, and somewhat\\nvolatile if he felt misunderstood or was unexpectedly interrupted\\nduring a conversation. Such reactions helped ensure that his\\n\\n\\x0ctargeting by bullies continued into his adult life, particularly in his\\nplace of work.\\n\\nI soon noticed, however, that things worked out quite well during\\n\\nour sessions if I kept mostly quiet. He would drop in, weekly or\\nbiweekly, and talk about what had befallen and preoccupied him\\nduring the previous seven to fourteen days. If I maintained silence\\nfor the first fifty minutes of our one-hour sessions, listening intently,\\nthen we could converse, in a relatively normal, reciprocal manner,\\nfor the remaining ten minutes. This pattern continued for more than\\na decade, as I learned, increasingly, to hold my tongue (something\\nthat does not come easily to me). As the years passed, however, I\\nnoticed that the proportion of time he spent discussing negative\\nissues with me decreased. Our conversation—his monologue, really—\\nhad always started with what was bothering him, and rarely\\nprogressed past that. But he worked hard outside our sessions,\\ncultivating friends, attending artistic gatherings and music festivals,\\nand resurrecting a long-dormant talent for composing songs and\\nplaying the guitar. As he became more social, he began to generate\\nsolutions to the problems he communicated to me, and to discuss, in\\nthe latter portion of the hours we shared, some of the more positive\\naspects of his existence. It was slow going, but he made continual\\nincremental progress. When he first came to see me, we could not sit\\ntogether at a table in a coffee shop—or, indeed, in any public space—\\nand practice anything resembling a real-world conversation without\\nhis being paralyzed into absolute silence. By the time we finished, he\\nwas reading his original poetry in front of small groups, and had\\neven tried his hand at stand-up comedy.\\n\\nHe was the best personal and practical exemplar of something I\\nhad come to realize over my more than twenty years of psychological\\npractice: people depend on constant communication with others to\\nkeep their minds organized. We all need to think to keep things\\nstraight, but we mostly think by talking. We need to talk about the\\npast, so we can distinguish the trivial, overblown concerns that\\notherwise plague our thoughts from the experiences that are truly\\nimportant. We need to talk about the nature of the present and our\\nplans for the future, so we know where we are, where we are going,\\nand why we are going there. We must submit the strategies and\\ntactics we formulate to the judgments of others, to ensure their\\nefficiency and resilience. We need to listen to ourselves as we talk, as\\n\\n\\x0c'"

       "'well, so that we may organize our otherwise inchoate bodily\\nreactions, motivations, and emotions into something articulate and\\norganized, and dispense with those concerns that are exaggerated\\nand irrational. We need to talk—both to remember and to forget.\\nMy client desperately needed someone to listen to him. He also\\nneeded to be fully part of additional, larger, and more complex social\\ngroups—something he planned in our sessions together, and then\\ncarried out on his own. Had he fallen prey to the temptation to\\ndenigrate the value of interpersonal interactions and relationships\\nbecause of his history of isolation and harsh treatment, he would\\nhave had very little chance of regaining his health and well-being.\\nInstead, he learned the ropes and joined the world.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nFor Drs. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the great depth\\npsychologists, sanity was a characteristic of the individual mind.\\nPeople were well-adjusted, in their views, when the subpersonalities\\nexisting within each of them were properly integrated and balanced\\nin expression. The id, the instinctive part of the psyche (from the\\nGerman “it,” representing nature, in all its power and foreignness,\\ninside us); the superego (the sometimes oppressive, internalized\\nrepresentative of social order); and the ego (the I, the personality\\nproper, crushed between those two necessary tyrants)—all had their\\nspecialized functions for Freud, who first conceptualized their\\nexistence. Id, ego, and superego interacted with each other like the\\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches of a modern government.\\nJung, although profoundly influenced by Freud, parsed the\\ncomplexity of the psyche in a different manner. For him, the ego of\\nthe individual had to find its proper place in relationship to the\\nshadow (the dark side of the personality), the anima or animus (the\\ncontrasexual and thus often repressed side of the personality), and\\nthe self (the internal being of ideal possibility). But all these different\\nsubentities, Jungian and Freudian alike, share one thing in common:\\nthey exist in the interior of the person, regardless of his or her\\nsurroundings. People are social beings, however—par excellence—\\nand there is no shortage of wisdom and guidance outside of us,\\nembedded in the social world. Why rely on our own limited resources\\n\\n\\x0cto remember the road, or to orient ourselves in new territory, when\\nwe can rely on signs and guideposts placed there so effortfully by\\nothers? Freud and Jung, with their intense focus on the autonomous\\nindividual psyche, placed too little focus on the role of the\\ncommunity in the maintenance of personal mental health.\\n\\nIt is for such reasons that I assess the position of all my new\\nclinical clients along a few dimensions largely dependent on the\\nsocial world when I first start working with them: Have they been\\neducated to the level of their intellectual ability or ambition? Is their\\nuse of free time engaging, meaningful, and productive? Have they\\nformulated solid and well-articulated plans for the future? Are they\\n(and those they are close to) free of any serious physical health or\\neconomic problems? Do they have friends and a social life? A stable\\nand satisfying intimate partnership? Close and functional familial\\nrelationships? A career—or, at least, a job—that is financially\\nsufficient, stable and, if possible, a source of satisfaction and\\nopportunity? If the answer to any three or more of these questions is\\nno, I consider that my new client is insufficiently embedded in the\\ninterpersonal world and is in danger of spiraling downward\\npsychologically because of that. People exist among other people and\\nnot as purely individual minds. An individual does not have to be\\nthat well put together if he or she can remain at least minimally\\nacceptable in behavior to others. Simply put: We outsource the\\nproblem of sanity. People remain mentally healthy not merely\\nbecause of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are\\nconstantly being reminded how to think, act, and speak by those\\naround them.\\n\\nIf you begin to deviate from the straight and narrow path—if you\\nbegin to act improperly—people will react to your errors before they\\nbecome too great, and cajole, laugh, tap, and criticize you back into\\nplace. They will raise an eyebrow, or smile (or not), or pay attention\\n(or not). If other people can tolerate having you around, in other\\nwords, they will constantly remind you not to misbehave, and just as\\nconstantly call on you to be at your best. All that is left for you to do\\nis watch, listen, and respond appropriately to the cues. Then you\\nmight remain motivated, and able to stay together enough so that\\nyou will not begin the long journey downhill. This is reason enough\\nto appreciate your immersion in the world of other people—friends,\\n\\n\\x0c'"
