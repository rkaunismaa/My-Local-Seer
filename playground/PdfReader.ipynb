It seems absurd, in\\nsome sense, even to think about anything else but that illness during\\nthis trying time. Nonetheless, binding all the thoughts contained in\\nany current work to the existence of the pandemic—which too shall\\npass—seems like an error, as the normal problems of life will return\\nat some point (and thankfully) to the forefront. That all means that\\nan author of the present day is inevitably going to make one mistake\\n(concentrating too much on the pandemic, which has an uncertain\\nlife span, and producing a book that is instantly dated, in\\nconsequence) or another (ignoring the pandemic, which is very much\\nlike failing to attend to the proverbial elephant under the rug).\\n\\nAfter considering this, as well as discussing the issues with my\\npublishers, I decided to write Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life\\naccording to the plan laid out for it several years ago, and to\\nconcentrate on addressing issues not specific to the current time\\n(thus, to risk the second error rather than the first). I suppose it may\\nalso be the case that those who have chosen to read this book or\\nlisten to the audio version might be relieved to turn their attention to\\nsomething other than the coronavirus and the devastation it has\\nwrought.\\n\\n\\x0cOverture\\n\\nOn the fifth of February 2020, I awoke in an intensive care ward in,\\nof all places, Moscow. I had six-inch tethers attaching me to the sides\\nof the bed because, in my unconscious state, I had been agitated\\nenough to try to remove the catheters from my arm and leave the\\nICU. I was confused and frustrated not knowing where I was,\\nsurrounded by people speaking a foreign language, and in the\\nabsence of my daughter, Mikhaila, and her husband, Andrey, who\\nwere restricted to short visiting hours and did not have permission to\\nbe there with me at my moment of wakening. I was angry, too, about\\nbeing there, and lunged at my daughter when she did visit several\\nhours later. I felt betrayed, although that was the furthest from the\\ntruth. People had been attending to my various needs with great\\ndiligence, and in the wake of the tremendous logistic challenges that\\ncome about from seeking medical care in a truly foreign country. I do\\nnot have any memory of anything that happened to me during the\\nmost recent weeks preceding that, and very little between that\\nmoment and my having entered a hospital in Toronto, in mid-\\nDecember. One of the few things I could recall, looking back to the\\nearliest days of the year, was the time I had spent writing this book.\\n\\nI wrote much and edited almost all of Beyond Order during a time\\nwhen my family was plagued by sequential and overlapping bouts of\\nseriously impaired health, much of which was the subject of public\\ndiscussion, and for that reason requires some detailed explanation.\\nFirst, in January 2019, Mikhaila had to seek out a surgeon to replace\\nmuch of her artificial ankle, implanted about a decade earlier, as the\\ninitial installation was never perfect, causing her serious pain and\\ntrouble with movement as a consequence, and then came near to\\nfailing. I spent a week with her at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland,\\nfor the week of that procedure and her initial recovery.\\n\\n\\x0cAt the beginning of March, my wife, Tammy, underwent routine\\n\\nsurgery in Toronto for a common and eminently treatable kidney\\ncancer. A month and a half after that surgery, which involved the\\nremoval of one third of the organ in question, we learned that she\\nwas actually suffering from an extremely rare malignancy, which had\\na one-year fatality rate of close to 100 percent.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the surgeons involved in her care removed the\\nremaining two thirds of her afflicted kidney, along with a substantial\\nproportion of the related abdominal lymphatic system. The surgery\\nappeared to bring the progression of the cancer to a halt, but\\nproduced leakage of fluid (up to four liters, or one gallon, a day) from\\nher now-damaged lymphatic system—a condition known as chylous\\nascites—which rivaled the original condition in danger. We\\njourneyed to see a medical team in Philadelphia, where within\\nninety-six hours of the initial injection of a poppy seed oil dye, whose\\npractical purpose was the enhancement of images derived from CAT\\nor MRI scans, the complete cessation of Tammy’s fluid loss was\\nachieved. This breakthrough occurred on the very day of our thirtieth\\nwedding anniversary. She recovered rapidly and, to all appearances,\\ncompletely—a testament to the luck without which none of us can\\nlive, and to her own admirable strength and resistance.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while these events unfolded, my health fell apart. I\\nhad begun to take an antianxiety agent at the beginning of 2017, after\\nsuffering from what appeared to be an autoimmune reaction to\\nsomething I had consumed during the Christmas holiday period of\\n2016.* The food reaction made me acutely and continually anxious,\\nas well as freezing cold, no matter what clothes I was wearing or how\\nmany blankets I layered upon myself. Further, it lowered my blood\\npressure so dramatically that whenever I tried to stand I would gray\\nout and be forced into a crouch half a dozen or more times before\\ntrying again. I also experienced insomnia that appeared near total.\\nMy family physician prescribed a benzodiazepine as well as a drug\\nfor sleeping. I took the latter a mere handful of times before ceasing\\nits use entirely; the terrible symptoms I was experiencing, including\\nthe insomnia, were almost immediately and entirely eradicated by\\nthe benzodiazepine treatment, making the sleep agent unnecessary. I\\ncontinued the benzodiazepine for almost exactly three years, because\\nmy life did seem unnaturally stressful during that time (the period\\nwhen my life changed from the quiet existence of a university\\n\\n\\x0cprofessor and clinician to the tumultuous reality of a public figure),\\nand because I believed that this drug was—as is often claimed of\\nbenzodiazepines—a relatively harmless substance.\\n\\nThings changed, however, in March 2019, at the onset of my wife’s\\n\\nmedical battle. My anxiety spiked noticeably after Mikhaila’s\\naforementioned hospitalization, surgery, and recovery. In\\nconsequence, I asked my family physician to increase my dose of\\nbenzodiazepine, so that I would not be preoccupied by nor preoccupy\\nothers with my anxiety. Unfortunately, I experienced a marked\\nincrease in negative emotion following the adjustment. I asked to\\nhave the dosage raised yet again (by this time, we were attempting to\\ndeal with the second of Tammy’s surgeries and its complications, and\\nI attributed my even more severe anxiety to that problem), but my\\nanxiety increased even further. I attributed all of this not to a\\nparadoxical reaction to the medication (which it was later diagnosed\\nas), but to the recurrence of a tendency toward depression that had\\nplagued me for years.* In any case, I ceased using the\\nbenzodiazepine entirely in May of that year, trying two doses of\\nketamine within a week, as suggested by a psychiatrist with whom I\\nconsulted. Ketamine, a nonstandard anesthetic/psychedelic,\\nsometimes has overwhelming and sudden positive effects on\\ndepression. It produced nothing for me but two ninety-minute trips\\nto hell. I felt to my bones as if I had everything to feel guilty and\\nashamed about, with nothing gained by my positive experiences.\\n\\nA few days after the second ketamine experience, I began to suffer\\n\\nthe effects of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal, which were truly\\nintolerable—anxiety far beyond what I had ever experienced, an\\nuncontrollable restlessness and need to move (formally known as\\nakathisia), overwhelming thoughts of self-destruction, and the\\ncomplete absence of any happiness whatsoever. A family friend—a\\nphysician—enlightened me as to the dangers of sudden\\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal. I therefore started to take a\\nbenzodiazepine once again—but a smaller dose than I had climbed to\\npreviously. Many, but not all, of my symptoms abated. To deal with\\nthose that remained, I also began to take an antidepressant that had\\nbeen of great use to me in the past. All it did, however, was make me\\nexhausted enough to require an additional four or more hours of\\nsleep a day—which was not helpful in the midst of Tammy’s serious\\nhealth issues—as well as increase my appetite two- or threefold.\\n\\n\\x0cAfter about three months of terrible anxiety, uncontrollable\\n\\nhypersomnia, viciously torturous akathisia, and excessive appetite, I\\ntraveled to an American clinic that claimed to specialize in rapid\\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal. Despite the good intentions of many of\\nits psychiatrists, the clinic managed only a slow cessation or tapering\\nof my benzodiazepine dosage, the negative effects of which I was\\nalready experiencing and which were not and could not be controlled\\nto any significant degree whatsoever by the inpatient treatment\\noffered.\\n\\nI resided at that clinic, nonetheless, from mid-August, a mere few\\n\\ndays after Tammy had recovered from her postsurgical\\ncomplications, to late November, when I returned home to Toronto,\\nmuch the worse for wear. By this time, the akathisia (the disorder of\\nuncontrollable movement alluded to earlier) had increased to the\\npoint where I could not sit or rest in any position for any length of\\ntime whatsoever without severe distress. In December I checked in to\\na local hospital, and it was at that point that my awareness of events\\nprior to my awakening in Moscow ends. As I later learned, Mikhaila\\nand Andrey removed me from the Toronto hospital in early January\\n2020, believing that the treatment I received there was doing me\\nmore harm than good (an opinion I concurred with entirely once I\\nlearned of it).\\n\\nThe situation I found myself in upon reattaining consciousness in\\nRussia was complicated by the fact that I had also developed double\\npneumonia in Canada, although that was neither discovered nor\\ntreated until I was in the Moscow ICU. However, I was there\\nprimarily so that the clinic could facilitate my withdrawal from\\nbenzodiazepines, using a procedure either unknown or regarded as\\ntoo dangerous in North America. Since I had not been able to\\ntolerate any decrease in dosage whatsoever—apart from the initial\\nreduction, months before—the clinic placed me in a medically\\ninduced coma so that I might remain unconscious during the very\\nworst withdrawal symptoms. That regimen started January 5 and\\nlasted nine days, during which I was also placed in a machine so that\\nmy breathing was mechanically regulated. On January 14, I was\\ntaken off the anesthetic and the intubation. I woke up for a few\\nhours, and indicated during this time to Mikhaila that I was no\\nlonger suffering from akathisia, although I remember nothing of this.\\n\\n\\x0cOn January 23, I was moved to another ICU specializing in\\nneurological rehabilitation. I can recall waking up on the twenty-\\nsixth for a short period, until my more complete return to\\nconsciousness, as previously related, on February 5—ten days during\\nwhich I passed through a period of delirium of vivid intensity. Once\\nthat cleared, I moved to a more homelike rehabilitation center in the\\nouter suburbs of Moscow. While there, I had to relearn how to walk\\nand up and down stairs, button my clothes, lie down in bed on my\\nown, place my hands in the proper position on a computer keyboard,\\nand type. I did not seem to be able to see properly—or, more\\naccurately, see how to use my limbs to interact with what I perceived.\\nA few weeks later, after the problems in perception and coordination\\nhad essentially abated, Mikhaila, Andrey, their child, and I relocated\\nto Florida for what we hoped would be some peaceful time of\\nrecuperation in the sun (very much welcome after the cold grayness\\nof midwinter Moscow). This was immediately before worldwide\\nconcern erupted over the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIn Florida, I attempted to wean off the medication prescribed by\\nthe Moscow clinic, although I was still experiencing numbness in my\\nleft hand and foot, trembling of those two extremities as well as the\\nmuscles in my forehead, seizure activity, and crippling anxiety. All\\nthese symptoms increased quite markedly as my intake of\\nmedication decreased, reaching the point where about two months\\nlater I returned to the dosages initially prescribed in Russia. This was\\na material defeat, as the process of lessening their use had been\\nfueled by an optimism that was consequently shattered, as well as\\nreturning me to a state of medication usage that I had paid a heavy\\nprice for trying to eliminate. I had family members and friends stay\\nwith me during this time, thankfully, and their company helped me\\nstay motivated to continue while the symptoms I was experiencing\\ngrew unbearable, particularly in the morning.\\n\\nBy the end of May, three months after leaving Russia, it had\\nbecome obvious that I was worsening instead of improving, and\\nrelying on the people I loved and who reciprocated that emotion was\\nboth untenable and unfair. Mikhaila and Andrey had been in touch\\nwith a Serbian clinic that practiced a novel approach to the problem\\nof benzodiazepine withdrawal, and they made arrangements to move\\nme there, only two days after that country had reopened after the\\npandemic closure.\\n\\n\\x0cI am not going to make a claim that the events that befell my wife,\\nme, and those who were closely involved in her care added up, in the\\nfinal analysis, to some greater good. What happened to her was truly\\nawful. She experienced a severe and near-fatal crisis of health every\\ntwo or three days for more than half a year, and then had to cope\\nwith my illness and absence. I was plagued, for my part, with the\\nlikely loss of someone whom I had befriended for fifty years and been\\nmarried to for thirty; the observation of the terrible consequences of\\nthat on her other family members, including our children; and the\\ndire and dreadful consequences of a substance dependence I had\\nunwittingly stumbled into. I am not going to cheapen any of that by\\nclaiming that we became better people for living through it.\\nHowever, I can say that passing so near to death motivated my wife\\nto attend to some issues regarding her own spiritual and creative\\ndevelopment more immediately and assiduously than she might\\notherwise have, and me to write or to preserve while editing only\\nthose words in this book that retained their significance even under\\nconditions characterized by extreme suffering. It is certainly thanks\\nto family and friends (who are named specifically in the Coda of this\\nbook) that we are still alive, but it is also true that the meaningful\\nimmersion in what I was writing, which continued during the entire\\ntime I have related—excepting my unconscious month in Russia—\\nprovided me both with a reason to live and a means of testing the\\nviability of the thoughts with which I wrestled.\\n\\nI do not believe I have ever claimed—in my previous book or,\\n\\nindeed, this one—that it would be necessarily sufficient to live by the\\nrules I have presented. I think what I claimed—what I hope I claimed\\n—was this: When you are visited by chaos and swallowed up; when\\nnature curses you or someone you love with illness; or when tyranny\\nrends asunder something of value that you have built, it is salutary to\\nknow the rest of the story. All of that misfortune is only the bitter\\nhalf of the tale of existence, without taking note of the heroic element\\nof redemption or the nobility of the human spirit requiring a certain\\nresponsibility to shoulder. We ignore that addition to the story at our\\nperil, because life is so difficult that losing sight of the heroic part of\\nexistence could cost us everything. We do not want that to happen.\\nWe need instead to take heart, and to take spirit, and to look at\\nthings carefully and properly, and to live the way that we could live.\\n\\n\\x0cYou have sources of strength upon which you can draw, and even\\nthough they may not work well, they may be enough. You have what\\nyou can learn if you can accept your error. You have medications and\\nhospitals, as well as physicians and nurses who genuinely and\\nbravely care to lift you up and help you through every day. And then\\nyou have your own character and courage, and if those have been\\nbeat to a bloody pulp and you are ready to throw in the towel, you\\nhave the character and courage of those for whom you care and who\\ncare for you. And maybe, just maybe, with all that, you can get\\nthrough. I can tell you what has saved me, so far—the love I have for\\nmy family; the love they have for me; the encouragement they have\\ndelivered, along with my friends; the fact that I still had meaningful\\nwork I could struggle through while in the abyss. I had to force\\nmyself to sit down at the computer. I had to force myself to\\nconcentrate, and to breathe, and to keep from saying and meaning\\n“to hell with it” during the endless months that I was possessed by\\ndread and terror. And I was barely able to do it. More than half the\\ntime I believed that I was going to die in one of the many hospitals in\\nwhich I resided. And I believe that if I had fallen prey to resentment,\\nfor example, I would have perished once and for all—and that I am\\nfortunate to have avoided such a fate.\\n\\nIs it not possible (even though it may not always deliver us from\\nthe terrible situation that we find ourselves in) that we would all be\\nmore able to deal with uncertainty, the horrors of nature, the tyranny\\nof culture, and the malevolence of ourselves and others if we were\\nbetter and more courageous people? If we strived toward higher\\nvalues? If we were more truthful? Wouldn’t the beneficial elements\\nof experience be more likely to manifest themselves around us? Is it\\nnot possible, if your goals were noble enough, your courage\\nadequate, your aim at the truth unerring, that the Good thereby\\nproduced would . . . well, not justify the horror? That is not exactly\\nright, but it still comes close. Such attitudes and actions might at\\nleast provide us with meaning sufficient to stop our encounter with\\nthat terror and horror from corrupting us and turning the\\nsurrounding world into something all too closely resembling hell.\\n\\nWhy Beyond Order? It is simple, in some regard. Order is\\nexplored territory. We are in order when the actions we deem\\nappropriate produce the results we aim at. We regard such outcomes\\npositively, indicating as they do, first, that we have moved closer to\\n\\n\\x0cwhat we desire, and second, that our theory about how the world\\nworks remains acceptably accurate. Nonetheless, all states of order,\\nno matter how secure and comfortable, have their flaws. Our\\nknowledge of how to act in the world remains eternally incomplete—\\npartly because of our profound ignorance of the vast unknown, partly\\nbecause of our willful blindness, and partly because the world\\ncontinues, in its entropic manner, to transform itself unexpectedly.\\nFurthermore, the order we strive to impose on the world can rigidify\\nas a consequence of ill-advised attempts to eradicate from\\nconsideration all that is unknown. When such attempts go too far,\\ntotalitarianism threatens, driven by the desire to exercise full control\\nwhere such control is not possible, even in principle. This means\\nrisking a dangerous restriction of all the psychological and social\\nchanges necessary to maintain adaptation to the ever-changing\\nworld. And so we find ourselves inescapably faced with the need to\\nmove beyond order, into its opposite: chaos.\\n\\nIf order is where what we want makes itself known—when we act\\nin accordance with our hard-won wisdom—chaos is where what we\\ndo not expect or have remained blind to leaps forward from the\\npotential that surrounds us. The fact that something has occurred\\nmany times in the past is no guarantee that it will continue to occur\\nin the same manner.1 There exists, eternally, a domain beyond what\\nwe know and can predict. Chaos is anomaly, novelty,\\nunpredictability, transformation, disruption, and all too often,\\ndescent, as what we have come to take for granted reveals itself as\\nunreliable. Sometimes it manifests itself gently, revealing its\\nmysteries in experience that makes us curious, compelled, and\\ninterested. This is particularly likely, although not inevitable, when\\nwe approach what we do not understand voluntarily, with careful\\npreparation and discipline. Other times the unexpected makes itself\\nknown terribly, suddenly, accidentally, so we are undone, and fall\\napart, and can only put ourselves back together with great difficulty\\n—if at all.\\n\\nNeither the state of order nor the state of chaos is preferable,\\n\\nintrinsically, to the other. That is the wrong way to look at it.\\nNonetheless, in my previous book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to\\nChaos, I focused more on how the consequences of too much chaos\\nmight be remediated.2 We respond to sudden and unpredictable\\nchange by preparing, physiologically and psychologically, for the\\n\\n\\x0cworst. And because only God Himself knows what this worst might\\nbe, we must in our ignorance prepare for all eventualities. And the\\nproblem with that continual preparation is that, in excess, it exhausts\\nus. But that does not imply in any manner that chaos should be\\neliminated (an impossibility, in any case), although what is unknown\\nneeds to be managed carefully, as my previous book repeatedly\\nstressed. Whatever is not touched by the new stagnates, and it is\\ncertainly the case that a life without curiosity—that instinct pushing\\nus out into the unknown—would be a much-diminished form of\\nexistence. What is new is also what is exciting, compelling, and\\nprovocative, assuming that the rate at which it is introduced does not\\nintolerably undermine and destabilize our state of being.\\n\\nLike 12 Rules for Life, the current volume provides an explication\\n\\nof rules drawn from a longer list of 42, originally published and\\npopularized on the Q and A website Quora. Unlike my previous book,\\nBeyond Order explores as its overarching theme how the dangers of\\ntoo much security and control might be profitably avoided. Because\\nwhat we understand is insufficient (as we discover when things we\\nare striving to control nonetheless go wrong around us), we need to\\nkeep one foot within order while stretching the other tentatively into\\nthe beyond. And so we are driven to explore and find the deepest of\\nmeanings in standing on the frontier, secure enough to keep our fear\\nunder control but learning, constantly learning, as we face what we\\nhave not yet made peace with or adapted to. It is this instinct of\\nmeaning—something far deeper than mere thought—that orients us\\nproperly in life, so that we do not become overwhelmed by what is\\nbeyond us, or equally dangerously, stultified and stunted by dated,\\ntoo narrow, or too pridefully paraded systems of value and belief.\\n\\nWhat have I written about, more specifically? Rule I describes the\\n\\nrelationship between stable, predictable social structures and\\nindividual psychological health, and makes the case that such\\nstructures need to be updated by creative people if they are to retain\\ntheir vitality. Rule II analyzes a centuries-old alchemical image,\\nrelying on several stories—ancient and modern—to illuminate the\\nnature and development of the integrated human personality. Rule\\nIII warns of the dangers of avoiding the information (vital to the\\ncontinual rejuvenation of the psyche) signaled by the emergence of\\nnegative emotions such as pain, anxiety, and fear.\\n\\n\\x0cRule IV argues that the meaning that sustains people through\\ndifficult times is to be found not so much in happiness, which is\\nfleeting, but in in the voluntary adoption of mature responsibility for\\nthe self and others. Rule V uses a single example, drawn from my\\nexperience as a clinical psychologist, to illustrate the personal and\\nsocial necessity of attending to the dictates of conscience. Rule VI\\ndescribes the danger of attributing the cause of complex individual\\nand social problems to single variables such as sex, class, or power.\\nRule VII outlines the crucial relationship between disciplined\\nstriving in a single direction and forging of the individual character\\ncapable of resilience in the face of adversity. Rule VIII focuses on the\\nvital importance of aesthetic experience as a guide to what is true,\\ngood, and sustaining in the human world of experience. Rule IX\\nmakes the case that past experiences, whose current recall remains\\nladen with pain and fear, can be stripped of their horror by voluntary\\nverbal exploration and reconsideration.\\n\\nRule X notes the importance of explicit negotiation to\\nmaintenance of the good will, mutual regard, and heartfelt\\ncooperation without which no true romance can be sustained. Rule\\nXI opens by describing the world of human experience in a manner\\nthat explains what motivates three common but direly dangerous\\npatterns of psychological response, delineates the catastrophic\\nconsequences of falling prey to any or all of them, and lays out an\\nalternative route. Rule XII makes the case that thankfulness in the\\nface of the inevitable tragedies of life should be regarded as a\\nprimary manifestation of the admirable moral courage required to\\ncontinue our difficult march uphill.*\\n\\nI hope that I am somewhat wiser in my explication of this second\\nset of 12 rules than I was four years ago, when I wrote about the first\\ndozen—not least because of the informative feedback I received in\\nthe course of my efforts to formulate my ideas for audiences around\\nthe world, in person, on YouTube, and through my podcast and\\nblog.* I hope, in consequence, that I have managed to clarify some of\\nthe issues that were perhaps left less than optimally developed in my\\nprevious work, as well as presenting much that is original. Finally, I\\nhope that people find this book as helpful personally as they seem to\\nhave found the first set of 12 Rules. It has been a source of immense\\ngratification that so many people have reported drawing strength\\n\\n\\x0cfrom the thoughts and the stories I have had the privilege of bringing\\nforth and sharing.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\n\\nDO NOT CARELESSLY DENIGRATE SOCIAL\\nINSTITUTIONS OR CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENT\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nFor years, I saw a client who lived by himself.* He was isolated in\\nmany other ways in addition to his living situation. He had extremely\\nlimited family ties. Both of his daughters had moved out of the\\ncountry, and did not maintain much contact, and he had no other\\nrelatives except a father and sister from whom he was estranged. His\\nwife and the mother of his children had passed away years ago, and\\nthe sole relationship he endeavored to establish while he saw me\\nover the course of more than a decade and a half terminated\\ntragically when his new partner was killed in an automobile accident.\\n\\nWhen we began to work together, our conversations were\\n\\ndecidedly awkward. He was not accustomed to the subtleties of social\\ninteraction, so his behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, lacked the dance-\\nlike rhythm and harmony that characterize the socially fluent. As a\\nchild, he had been thoroughly ignored as well as actively discouraged\\nby both parents. His father—mostly absent—was neglectful and\\nsadistic in his inclinations, while his mother was chronically\\nalcoholic. He had also been consistently tormented and harassed at\\nschool, and had not chanced upon a teacher in all his years of\\neducation who paid him any genuine attention. These experiences\\nleft my client with a proclivity toward depression, or at least\\nworsened what might have been a biological tendency in that\\ndirection. He was, in consequence, abrupt, irritable, and somewhat\\nvolatile if he felt misunderstood or was unexpectedly interrupted\\nduring a conversation. Such reactions helped ensure that his\\n\\n\\x0ctargeting by bullies continued into his adult life, particularly in his\\nplace of work.\\n\\nI soon noticed, however, that things worked out quite well during\\n\\nour sessions if I kept mostly quiet. He would drop in, weekly or\\nbiweekly, and talk about what had befallen and preoccupied him\\nduring the previous seven to fourteen days. If I maintained silence\\nfor the first fifty minutes of our one-hour sessions, listening intently,\\nthen we could converse, in a relatively normal, reciprocal manner,\\nfor the remaining ten minutes. This pattern continued for more than\\na decade, as I learned, increasingly, to hold my tongue (something\\nthat does not come easily to me). As the years passed, however, I\\nnoticed that the proportion of time he spent discussing negative\\nissues with me decreased. Our conversation—his monologue, really—\\nhad always started with what was bothering him, and rarely\\nprogressed past that. But he worked hard outside our sessions,\\ncultivating friends, attending artistic gatherings and music festivals,\\nand resurrecting a long-dormant talent for composing songs and\\nplaying the guitar. As he became more social, he began to generate\\nsolutions to the problems he communicated to me, and to discuss, in\\nthe latter portion of the hours we shared, some of the more positive\\naspects of his existence. It was slow going, but he made continual\\nincremental progress. When he first came to see me, we could not sit\\ntogether at a table in a coffee shop—or, indeed, in any public space—\\nand practice anything resembling a real-world conversation without\\nhis being paralyzed into absolute silence. By the time we finished, he\\nwas reading his original poetry in front of small groups, and had\\neven tried his hand at stand-up comedy.\\n\\nHe was the best personal and practical exemplar of something I\\nhad come to realize over my more than twenty years of psychological\\npractice: people depend on constant communication with others to\\nkeep their minds organized. We all need to think to keep things\\nstraight, but we mostly think by talking. We need to talk about the\\npast, so we can distinguish the trivial, overblown concerns that\\notherwise plague our thoughts from the experiences that are truly\\nimportant. We need to talk about the nature of the present and our\\nplans for the future, so we know where we are, where we are going,\\nand why we are going there. We must submit the strategies and\\ntactics we formulate to the judgments of others, to ensure their\\nefficiency and resilience. We need to listen to ourselves as we talk, as\\n\\n\\x0cwell, so that we may organize our otherwise inchoate bodily\\nreactions, motivations, and emotions into something articulate and\\norganized, and dispense with those concerns that are exaggerated\\nand irrational. We need to talk—both to remember and to forget.\\nMy client desperately needed someone to listen to him. He also\\nneeded to be fully part of additional, larger, and more complex social\\ngroups—something he planned in our sessions together, and then\\ncarried out on his own. Had he fallen prey to the temptation to\\ndenigrate the value of interpersonal interactions and relationships\\nbecause of his history of isolation and harsh treatment, he would\\nhave had very little chance of regaining his health and well-being.\\nInstead, he learned the ropes and joined the world.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nFor Drs. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the great depth\\npsychologists, sanity was a characteristic of the individual mind.\\nPeople were well-adjusted, in their views, when the subpersonalities\\nexisting within each of them were properly integrated and balanced\\nin expression. The id, the instinctive part of the psyche (from the\\nGerman “it,” representing nature, in all its power and foreignness,\\ninside us); the superego (the sometimes oppressive, internalized\\nrepresentative of social order); and the ego (the I, the personality\\nproper, crushed between those two necessary tyrants)—all had their\\nspecialized functions for Freud, who first conceptualized their\\nexistence. Id, ego, and superego interacted with each other like the\\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches of a modern government.\\nJung, although profoundly influenced by Freud, parsed the\\ncomplexity of the psyche in a different manner. For him, the ego of\\nthe individual had to find its proper place in relationship to the\\nshadow (the dark side of the personality), the anima or animus (the\\ncontrasexual and thus often repressed side of the personality), and\\nthe self (the internal being of ideal possibility). But all these different\\nsubentities, Jungian and Freudian alike, share one thing in common:\\nthey exist in the interior of the person, regardless of his or her\\nsurroundings. People are social beings, however—par excellence—\\nand there is no shortage of wisdom and guidance outside of us,\\nembedded in the social world. Why rely on our own limited resources\\n\\n\\x0cto remember the road, or to orient ourselves in new territory, when\\nwe can rely on signs and guideposts placed there so effortfully by\\nothers? Freud and Jung, with their intense focus on the autonomous\\nindividual psyche, placed too little focus on the role of the\\ncommunity in the maintenance of personal mental health.\\n\\nIt is for such reasons that I assess the position of all my new\\nclinical clients along a few dimensions largely dependent on the\\nsocial world when I first start working with them: Have they been\\neducated to the level of their intellectual ability or ambition? Is their\\nuse of free time engaging, meaningful, and productive? Have they\\nformulated solid and well-articulated plans for the future? Are they\\n(and those they are close to) free of any serious physical health or\\neconomic problems? Do they have friends and a social life? A stable\\nand satisfying intimate partnership? Close and functional familial\\nrelationships? A career—or, at least, a job—that is financially\\nsufficient, stable and, if possible, a source of satisfaction and\\nopportunity? If the answer to any three or more of these questions is\\nno, I consider that my new client is insufficiently embedded in the\\ninterpersonal world and is in danger of spiraling downward\\npsychologically because of that. People exist among other people and\\nnot as purely individual minds. An individual does not have to be\\nthat well put together if he or she can remain at least minimally\\nacceptable in behavior to others. Simply put: We outsource the\\nproblem of sanity. People remain mentally healthy not merely\\nbecause of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are\\nconstantly being reminded how to think, act, and speak by those\\naround them.\\n\\nIf you begin to deviate from the straight and narrow path—if you\\nbegin to act improperly—people will react to your errors before they\\nbecome too great, and cajole, laugh, tap, and criticize you back into\\nplace. They will raise an eyebrow, or smile (or not), or pay attention\\n(or not). If other people can tolerate having you around, in other\\nwords, they will constantly remind you not to misbehave, and just as\\nconstantly call on you to be at your best. All that is left for you to do\\nis watch, listen, and respond appropriately to the cues. Then you\\nmight remain motivated, and able to stay together enough so that\\nyou will not begin the long journey downhill. This is reason enough\\nto appreciate your immersion in the world of other people—friends,\\n\\n\\x0cfamily members, and foes alike—despite the anxiety and frustration\\nthat social interactions so often produce.\\n\\nBut how did we develop the broad consensus regarding social\\nbehavior that serves to buttress our psychological stability? It seems\\na daunting task—if not impossible—in the face of the complexity that\\nconstantly confronts us. “Do we pursue this or that?” “How does the\\nworth of this piece of work compare to the worth of that?” “Who is\\nmore competent, or more creative, or more assertive, and should\\ntherefore be ceded authority?” Answers to such questions are largely\\nformulated in consequence of intensive negotiation—verbal and\\nnonverbal—regulating individual action, cooperation, and\\ncompetition. What we deem to be valuable and worthy of attention\\nbecomes part of the social contract; part of the rewards and\\npunishments meted out respectively for compliance and\\nnoncompliance; part of what continually indicates and reminds:\\n“Here is what is valued. Look at that (perceive that) and not\\nsomething else. Pursue that (act toward that end) and not some\\nother.” Compliance with those indications and reminders is, in large\\nmeasure, sanity itself—and is something required from every one of\\nus right from the early stages of our lives. Without the\\nintermediation of the social world, it would be impossible for us to\\norganize our minds, and we would simply be overwhelmed by the\\nworld.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI have the great good fortune of a granddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett\\nPeterson Korikova, born in August 2017. I have watched her carefully\\nwhile she develops, trying to understand what she is up to and\\nplaying along with it. When she was about a year and a half old, she\\nengaged in all manner of unbearably endearing behaviors—giggling\\nand laughing when she was poked, high-fiving, bumping heads, and\\nrubbing noses. However, in my opinion, the most noteworthy of all\\nthe actions she undertook at that age was her pointing.\\n\\nShe had discovered her index finger, using it to specify all the\\nobjects in the world she found interesting. She delighted in doing so,\\nparticularly when her pointing called forth the attention of the adults\\nsurrounding her. This indicated, in a manner not duplicable in any\\n\\n\\x0cother way, that her action and intention had import—definable at\\nleast in part as the tendency of a behavior or attitude to compel the\\nattention of others. She thrived on that, and no wonder. We compete\\nfor attention, personally, socially, and economically. No currency has\\na value that exceeds it. Children, adults, and societies wither on the\\nvine in its absence. To have others attend to what you find important\\nor interesting is to validate, first, the importance of what you are\\nattending to, but second, and more crucially, to validate you as a\\nrespected center of conscious experience and contributor to the\\ncollective world. Pointing is, as well, a crucial precursor to the\\ndevelopment of language. To name something—to use the word for\\nthe thing—is essentially to point to it, to specify it against everything\\nelse, to isolate it for use individually and socially.\\n\\nWhen my granddaughter pointed, she did it publicly. When she\\npointed to something, she could immediately observe how the people\\nclose to her reacted. There is just not that much point, so to speak, in\\npointing to something that no one else cares about. So, she aimed her\\nindex finger at something she found interesting and then looked\\naround to see if anyone else cared. She was learning an important\\nlesson at an early age: If you are not communicating about anything\\nthat engages other people, then the value of your communication—\\neven the value of your very presence—risks falling to zero. It was in\\nthis manner that she began to more profoundly explore the complex\\nhierarchy of value that made up her family and the broader society\\nsurrounding her.\\n\\nScarlett is now learning to talk—a more sophisticated form of\\npointing (and of exploration). Every word is a pointer, as well as a\\nsimplification or generalization. To name something is not only to\\nmake it shine forth against the infinite background of potentially\\nnameable things, but to group or categorize it, simultaneously, with\\nmany other phenomena of its broad utility or significance. We use\\nthe word “floor,” for example, but do not generally employ a separate\\nword for all the floors we might encounter (concrete, wood, earth,\\nglass), much less all the endless variations of color and texture and\\nshade that make up the details of the floors that bear our weight. We\\nuse a low-resolution representation: If it holds us up, we can walk on\\nit, and is situated inside a building, then it is a “floor,” and that is\\nprecise enough. The word distinguishes floors, say, from walls, but\\n\\n\\x0calso restricts the variability in all the floors that exist to a single\\nconcept—flat, stable, walkable indoor surfaces.\\n\\nThe words we employ are tools that structure our experience,\\nsubjectively and privately—but are, equally, socially determined. We\\nwould not all know and use the word “floor” unless we had all agreed\\nthat there was something sufficiently important about floors to\\njustify a word for them. So, the mere fact of naming something (and,\\nof course, agreeing on the name) is an important part of the process\\nwhereby the infinitely complex world of phenomena and fact is\\nreduced to the functional world of value. And it is continual\\ninteraction with social institutions that makes this reduction—this\\nspecification—possible.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe social world narrows and specifies the world for us, marking out\\nwhat is important. But what does “important” mean? How is it\\ndetermined? The individual is molded by the social world. But social\\ninstitutions are molded, too, by the requirements of the individuals\\nwho compose them. Arrangements must be made for our\\nprovisioning with the basic requirements of life. We cannot live\\nwithout food, water, clean air, and shelter. Less self-evidently, we\\nrequire companionship, play, touch, and intimacy. These are all\\nbiological as well as psychological necessities (and this is by no\\nmeans a comprehensive list). We must signify and then utilize those\\nelements of the world capable of providing us with these\\nrequirements. And the fact that we are deeply social adds another set\\nof constraints to the situation: We must perceive and act in a manner\\nthat meets our biological and psychological needs—but, since none of\\nus lives or can live in isolation, we must meet them in a manner\\napproved of by others. This means that the solutions we apply to our\\nfundamental biological problems must also be acceptable and\\nimplementable socially.\\n\\nIt is worth considering more deeply just how necessity limits the\\n\\nuniverse of viable solutions and implementable plans. First, as we\\nalluded to, the plan must in principle solve some real problem.\\nSecond, it must appeal to others—often in the face of competing\\nplans—or those others will not cooperate and might well object. If I\\n\\n\\x0cvalue something, therefore, I must determine how to value it so that\\nothers potentially benefit. It cannot just be good for me: it must be\\ngood for me and for the people around me. And even that is not good\\nenough—which means there are even more constraints on how the\\nworld must be perceived and acted upon. The manner in which I\\nview and value the world, integrally associated with the plans I am\\nmaking, has to work for me, my family, and the broader community.\\nFurthermore, it needs to work today, in a manner that does not make\\na worse hash of tomorrow, next week, next month, and next year\\n(even the next decade or century). A good solution to a problem\\ninvolving suffering must be repeatable, without deterioration across\\nrepetitions—iterable, in a word—across people and across time.\\n\\nThese universal constraints, manifest biologically and imposed\\n\\nsocially, reduce the complexity of the world to something\\napproximating a universally understandable domain of value. That is\\nexceptionally important, because there are unlimited problems and\\nthere are hypothetically unlimited potential solutions, but there are a\\ncomparatively limited number of solutions that work practically,\\npsychologically, and socially simultaneously. The fact of limited\\nsolutions implies the existence of something like a natural ethic—\\nvariable, perhaps, as human languages are variable, but still\\ncharacterized by something solid and universally recognizable at its\\nbase. It is the reality of this natural ethic that makes thoughtless\\ndenigration of social institutions both wrong and dangerous: wrong\\nand dangerous because those institutions have evolved to solve\\nproblems that must be solved for life to continue. They are by no\\nmeans perfect—but making them better, rather than worse, is a\\ntricky problem indeed.\\n\\nSo, I must take the complexity of the world, reduce it to a single\\npoint so that I can act, and take everyone else and their future selves\\ninto consideration while I am doing so. How do I manage this? By\\ncommunicating and negotiating. By outsourcing the terribly complex\\ncognitive problem to the resources of the broader world. The\\nindividuals who compose every society cooperate and compete\\nlinguistically (although linguistic interaction by no means exhausts\\nthe means of cooperation and competition). Words are formulated\\ncollectively, and everyone must agree on their use. The verbal\\nframework that helps us delimit the world is a consequence of the\\nlandscape of value that is constructed socially—but also bounded by\\n\\n\\x0cthe brute necessity of reality itself. This helps give that landscape\\nshape, and not just any old shape. This is where hierarchies—\\nfunctional, productive hierarchies—more clearly enter the picture.\\n\\nThings of import must be done, or people starve or die of thirst or\\n\\nexposure—or of loneliness and absence of touch. What needs to be\\ndone must be specified and planned. The requisite skills for doing so\\nmust be developed. That specification, planning, and development of\\nskills, as well as the implementation of the informed plan, must be\\nconducted in social space, with the cooperation of others (and in the\\nface of their competition). In consequence, some will be better at\\nsolving the problem at hand, and others worse. This variance in\\nability (as well as the multiplicity of extant problems and the\\nimpossibility of training everyone in all skilled domains) necessarily\\nengenders a hierarchical structure—based ideally on genuine\\ncompetence in relation to the goal. Such a hierarchy is in its essence\\na socially structured tool that must be employed for the effective\\naccomplishment of necessary and worthwhile tasks. It is also a social\\ninstitution that makes progress and peace possible at the same time.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe consensus making up the spoken and unspoken assumptions of\\nworth characterizing our societies has an ancient origin, developing\\nover the course of hundreds of millions of years. After all, “How\\nshould you act?” is just the short-term, immediate version of the\\nfundamental long-term question, “How should you survive?” It is\\ntherefore instructive to look into the distant past—far down the\\nevolutionary chain, right to the basics—and contemplate the\\nestablishment of what is important. The most phylogenetically\\nancient multicellular organisms (that is far enough for our purposes)\\ntend to be composed of relatively undifferentiated sensorimotor\\ncells.1 These cells map certain facts or features of the environment\\ndirectly onto the motor output of the same cells, in an essentially\\none-to-one relationship. Stimulus A means response A, and nothing\\nelse, while stimulus B means response B. Among more differentiated\\nand complex creatures—the larger and commonly recognizable\\ndenizens of the natural world—the sensory and motor functions\\nseparate and specialize, such that cells undertaking the former\\n\\n\\x0cfunctions detect patterns in the world and cells in the latter produce\\npatterns of motor output. This differentiation enables a broader\\nrange of patterns to be recognized and mapped, as well as a broader\\nrange of action and reaction to be undertaken. A third type of cell—\\nneural—emerges sometimes, as well, serving as a computational\\nintermediary between the first two. Among species that have\\nestablished a neural level of operation, the “same” pattern of input\\ncan produce a different pattern of output (depending, for example,\\non changes in the animal’s environment or internal psychophysical\\ncondition).\\n\\nAs nervous systems increase in sophistication, and more and more\\n\\nlayers of neural intermediation emerge, the relationship between\\nsimple fact and motor output becomes increasingly complex,\\nunpredictable, and sophisticated. What is putatively the same thing\\nor situation can be perceived in multiple ways, and two things\\nperceived in the same manner can still give rise to very different\\nbehaviors. It is very difficult to constrain even isolated laboratory\\nanimals, for example, so thoroughly that they will behave predictably\\nacross trials that have been made as similar as possible. As the layers\\nof neural tissue mediating between sensation and action multiply,\\nthey also differentiate. Basic motivational systems, often known as\\ndrives, appear (hunger, thirst, aggression, etc.), adding additional\\nsensory and behavioral specificity and variability. Superseding\\nmotivations, in turn—with no clear line of demarcation—are systems\\nof emotion. Cognitive systems emerge much later, first taking form,\\narguably, as imagination, and later—and only among human beings\\n—as full-fledged language. Thus, in the most complex of creatures,\\nthere is an internal hierarchy of structure, from reflex through drive\\nto language-mediated action (in the particular case of human\\nbeings), that must be organized before it can function as a unity and\\nbe aimed at a point.2\\n\\nHow is this hierarchy organized—a structure that emerged in large\\n\\npart from the bottom up, over the vast spans of evolutionary time?\\nWe return to the same answer alluded to earlier: through the\\nconstant cooperation and competition—the constant jockeying for\\nresources and position—defining the struggle for survival and\\nreproduction. This happens over the unimaginably lengthy spans of\\ntime that characterize evolution, as well as the much shorter course\\nof each individual life. Negotiation for position sorts organisms into\\n\\n\\x0cthe omnipresent hierarchies that govern access to vital resources\\nsuch as shelter, nourishment, and mates. All creatures of reasonable\\ncomplexity and even a minimally social nature have their particular\\nplace, and know it. All social creatures also learn what is deemed\\nvaluable by other group members, and derive from that, as well as\\nfrom the understanding of their own position, a sophisticated\\nimplicit and explicit understanding of value itself. In a phrase: The\\ninternal hierarchy that translates facts into actions mirrors the\\nexternal hierarchy of social organization. It is clear, for example, that\\nchimpanzees in a troop understand their social world and its\\nhierarchical strata at a fine level of detail. They know what is\\nimportant, and who has privileged access to it. They understand such\\nthings as if their survival and reproduction depend upon it, as it\\ndoes.3\\n\\nA newborn infant is equipped with relatively deterministic\\nreflexes: sucking, crying, startling. These nonetheless provide the\\nstarting point for the immense range of skills in action that develop\\nwith human maturation. By the age of two (and often much earlier\\nthan that, for many skills), children can orient with all their senses,\\nwalk upright, use their opposable-thumb-equipped hands for all\\nsorts of purposes, and communicate their desires and needs both\\nnonverbally and verbally—and this is of course a partial list. This\\nimmense array of behavioral abilities is integrated into a complex\\nassortment of emotions and motivational drives (anger, sadness,\\nfear, joy, surprise, and more) and then organized to fulfill whatever\\nspecific, narrow purpose inspires the child for the moment and,\\nincreasingly, over longer spans of time.\\n\\nThe developing infant must also hone and perfect the operation of\\nhis or her currently dominant motivational state in harmony with all\\nhis or her other internal motivational states (as, for example, the\\nseparate desire to eat, sleep, and play must learn to coexist so each\\ncan manifest itself optimally), and in keeping with the demands,\\nroutines, and opportunities of the social environment. This honing\\nand perfecting begin within the child’s maternal relationship and the\\nspontaneous play behavior within that circumscribed but still social\\ncontext. Then, when the child has matured to the point where the\\ninternal hierarchy of emotional and motivational functions can be\\nsubsumed, even temporarily, within a framework provided by a\\nconscious, communicable abstract goal (“let us play house”), the\\n\\n\\x0cchild is ready to play with others—and to do so, over time, in an\\nincreasingly complex and sophisticated manner.4\\n\\nPlay with others depends (as the great developmental psychologist\\nJean Piaget observed5) upon the collective establishment of a shared\\ngoal with the child’s play partners. The collective establishment of a\\nshared goal—the point of the game—conjoined with rules governing\\ncooperation and competition in relationship to that goal or point,\\nconstitutes a true social microcosm. All societies might be regarded\\nas variations upon this play/game theme—E pluribus unum*—and in\\nall functional and decent societies the basic rules of fair play,\\npredicated upon reciprocity across situation and time, come\\ninevitably to apply. Games, like solutions to problems, must be\\niterable to endure, and there are principles that apply to and\\nundergird what constitutes that iterability. Piaget suspected, for\\nexample, that games undertaken voluntarily will outcompete games\\nimposed and played under threat of force, given that some of the\\nenergy that could be expended on the game itself, whatever its\\nnature, has to be wasted on enforcement. There is evidence\\nindicating the emergence of such voluntary game-like arrangements\\neven among our nonhuman kin.6\\n\\nThe universal rules of fair play include the ability to regulate\\n\\nemotion and motivation while cooperating and competing in pursuit\\nof the goal during the game (that is part and parcel of being able to\\nplay at all), as well as the ability and will to establish reciprocally\\nbeneficial interactions across time and situation, as we already\\ndiscussed. And life is not simply a game, but a series of games, each\\nof which has something in common (whatever defines a game) and\\nsomething unique (or there would be no reason for multiple games).\\nAt minimum, there is a starting point (kindergarten, a 0–0 score, a\\nfirst date, an entry-level job) that needs to be improved upon; a\\nprocedure for enacting that improvement; and a desirable goal\\n(graduation from high school, a winning score, a permanent\\nromantic relationship, a prestigious career). Because of that\\ncommonality, there is an ethic—or more properly, a meta-ethic—that\\nemerges, from the bottom up, across the set of all games. The best\\nplayer is therefore not the winner of any given game but, among\\nmany other things, he or she who is invited by the largest number of\\nothers to play the most extensive series of games. It is for this reason,\\nwhich you may not understand explicitly at the time, that you tell\\n\\n\\x0cyour children: “It’s not whether you win or lose. It’s how you play the\\ngame!”* How should you play, to be that most desirable of players?\\nWhat structure must take form within you so that such play is\\npossible? And those two questions are interrelated, because the\\nstructure that will enable you to play properly (and with increasing\\nand automated or habitual precision) will emerge only in the process\\nof continually practicing the art of playing properly. Where might\\nyou learn how to play? Everywhere . . . if you are fortunate and\\nawake.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIt is useful to take your place at the bottom of a hierarchy. It can aid\\nin the development of gratitude and humility. Gratitude: There are\\npeople whose expertise exceeds your own, and you should be wisely\\npleased about that. There are many valuable niches to fill, given the\\nmany complex and serious problems we must solve. The fact that\\nthere are people who fill those niches with trustworthy skill and\\nexperience is something for which to be truly thankful. Humility: It\\nis better to presume ignorance and invite learning than to assume\\nsufficient knowledge and risk the consequent blindness. It is much\\nbetter to make friends with what you do not know than with what\\nyou do know, as there is an infinite supply of the former but a finite\\nstock of the latter. When you are tightly boxed in or cornered—all too\\noften by your own stubborn and fixed adherence to some\\nunconsciously worshipped assumptions—all there is to help you is\\nwhat you have not yet learned.\\n\\nIt is necessary and helpful to be, and in some ways to remain, a\\n\\nbeginner. For this reason, the Tarot deck beloved by intuitives,\\nromantics, fortune-tellers, and scoundrels alike contains within it the\\nFool as a positive card, an illustrated variant of which opens this\\nchapter. The Fool is a young, handsome man, eyes lifted upward,\\njourneying in the mountains, sun shining brightly upon him—about\\nto carelessly step over a cliff (or is he?). His strength, however, is\\nprecisely his willingness to risk such a drop; to risk being once again\\nat the bottom. No one unwilling to be a foolish beginner can learn. It\\nwas for this reason, among others, that Carl Jung regarded the Fool\\n\\n\\x0cas the archetypal precursor to the figure of the equally archetypal\\nRedeemer, the perfected individual.\\n\\nThe beginner, the fool, is continually required to be patient and\\n\\ntolerant—with himself and, equally, with others. His displays of\\nignorance, inexperience, and lack of skill may still sometimes be\\nrightly attributed to irresponsibility and condemned, justly, by\\nothers. But the insufficiency of the fool is often better regarded as an\\ninevitable consequence of each individual’s essential vulnerability,\\nrather than as a true moral failing. Much that is great starts small,\\nignorant, and useless. This lesson permeates popular as well as\\nclassical or traditional culture. Consider, for example, the Disney\\nheroes Pinocchio and Simba, as well as J. K. Rowling’s magical Harry\\nPotter. Pinocchio begins as a wooden-headed marionette, the puppet\\nof everyone’s decisions but his own. The Lion King has his origin as a\\nnaive cub, the unwitting pawn of a treacherous and malevolent\\nuncle. The student of wizarding is an unloved orphan, with a dusty\\ncupboard for a bedroom, and Voldemort—who might as well be\\nSatan himself—for his archenemy. Great mythologized heroes often\\ncome into the world, likewise, in the most meager of circumstances\\n(as the child of an Israelite slave, for example, or newborn in a lowly\\nmanger) and in great danger (consider the Pharaoh’s decision to slay\\nall the firstborn male babies of the Israelites, and Herod’s\\ncomparable edict, much later). But today’s beginner is tomorrow’s\\nmaster. Thus, it is necessary even for the most accomplished (but\\nwho wishes to accomplish still more) to retain identification with the\\nas yet unsuccessful; to appreciate the striving toward competence; to\\ncarefully and with true humility subordinate him or herself to the\\ncurrent game; and to develop the knowledge, self-control, and\\ndiscipline necessary to make the next move.\\n\\nI visited a restaurant in Toronto with my wife, son, and daughter\\n\\nwhile writing this. As I made my way to my party’s table, a young\\nwaiter asked if he might say a few words to me. He told me that he\\nhad been watching my videos, listening to my podcasts, and reading\\nmy book, and that he had, in consequence, changed his attitude\\ntoward his comparatively lower-status (but still useful and\\nnecessary) job. He had ceased criticizing what he was doing or\\nhimself for doing it, deciding instead to be grateful and seek out\\nwhatever opportunities presented themselves right there before him.\\nHe made up his mind to become more diligent and reliable and to\\n\\n\\x0csee what would happen if he worked as hard at it as he could. He told\\nme, with an uncontrived smile, that he had been promoted three\\ntimes in six months.\\n\\nThe young man had come to realize that every place he might find\\n\\nhimself in had more potential than he might first see (particularly\\nwhen his vision was impaired by the resentment and cynicism he felt\\nfrom being near the bottom). After all, it is not as if a restaurant is a\\nsimple place—and this was part of an extensive national\\norganization, a large, high-quality chain. To do a good job in such a\\nplace, servers must get along with the cooks, who are by universal\\nrecognition a formidably troublesome and tricky lot. They must also\\nbe polite and engaging with customers. They have to pay attention\\nconstantly. They must adjust to highly varying workloads—the\\nrushes and dead times that inevitably accompany the life of a server.\\nThey have to show up on time, sober and awake. They must treat\\ntheir superiors with the proper respect and do the same for those—\\nsuch as the dishwashers—below them in the structure of authority.\\nAnd if they do all these things, and happen to be working in a\\nfunctional institution, they will soon render themselves difficult to\\nreplace. Customers, colleagues, and superiors alike will begin to react\\nto them in an increasingly positive manner. Doors that would\\notherwise remain closed to them—even invisible—will be opened.\\nFurthermore, the skills they acquire will prove eminently portable,\\nwhether they continue to rise in the hierarchy of restaurateurs,\\ndecide instead to further their education, or change their career\\ntrajectory completely (in which case they will leave with laudatory\\npraise from their previous employers and vastly increased chances of\\ndiscovering the next opportunity).\\n\\nAs might be expected, the young man who had something to say to\\nme was thrilled with what had happened to him. His status concerns\\nhad been solidly and realistically addressed by his rapid career\\nadvance, and the additional money he was making did not hurt,\\neither. He had accepted, and therefore transcended, his role as a\\nbeginner. He had ceased being casually cynical about the place he\\noccupied in the world and the people who surrounded him, and\\naccepted the structure and the position he was offered. He started to\\nsee possibility and opportunity, where before he was blinded,\\nessentially, by his pride. He stopped denigrating the social institution\\n\\n\\x0che found himself part of and began to play his part properly. And\\nthat increment in humility paid off in spades.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIt is good to be a beginner, but it is a good of a different sort to be an\\nequal among equals. It is said, with much truth, that genuine\\ncommunication can take place only between peers. This is because it\\nis very difficult to move information up a hierarchy. Those well\\npositioned (and this is a great danger of moving up) have used their\\ncurrent competence—their cherished opinions, their present\\nknowledge, their current skills—to stake a moral claim to their\\nstatus. In consequence, they have little motivation to admit to error,\\nto learn or change—and plenty of reason not to. If a subordinate\\nexposes the ignorance of someone with greater status, he risks\\nhumiliating that person, questioning the validity of the latter’s claim\\nto influence and status, and revealing him as incompetent, outdated,\\nor false. For this reason, it is very wise to approach your boss, for\\nexample, carefully and privately with a problem (and perhaps best to\\nhave a solution at hand—and not one proffered too incautiously).\\n\\nBarriers exist to the flow of genuine information down a\\n\\nhierarchy, as well. For example, the resentment people lower in the\\nchain of command might feel about their hypothetically lesser\\nposition can make them loath to act productively on information\\nfrom above—or, in the worst case, can motivate them to work at\\ncounterpurposes to what they have learned, out of sheer spite. In\\naddition, those who are inexperienced or less educated, or who newly\\noccupy a subordinate position and therefore lack knowledge of their\\nsurroundings, can be more easily influenced by relative position and\\nthe exercise of power, instead of quality of argumentation and\\nobservation of competence. Peers, by contrast, must in the main be\\nconvinced. Their attention must be carefully reciprocated. To be\\nsurrounded by peers is to exist in a state of equality, and to manifest\\nthe give-and-take necessary to maintain that equality. It is therefore\\ngood to be in the middle of a hierarchy.\\n\\nThis is partly why friendships are so important, and why they form\\n\\nso early in life. A two-year-old, typically, is self-concerned, although\\nalso capable of simple reciprocal actions. The same Scarlett whom I\\n\\n\\x0ctalked about earlier—my granddaughter—would happily hand me\\none of her favorite stuffed toys, attached to a pacifier, when I asked\\nher to. Then I would hand it, or toss it, back (sometimes she would\\ntoss it to me, too—or at least relatively near me). She loved this\\ngame. We played it with a spoon, as well—an implement she was just\\nbeginning to master. She played the same way with her mother and\\nher grandmother—with anyone who happened to be within playing\\ndistance, if she was familiar enough with them not to be shy. This\\nwas the beginning of the behaviors that transform themselves into\\nfull-fledged sharing among older children.\\n\\nMy daughter, Mikhaila, Scarlett’s mother, took her child to the\\noutdoor recreational space on top of their downtown condo a few\\ndays before I wrote this. A number of other children were playing\\nthere, most of them older, and there were plenty of toys. Scarlett\\nspent her time hoarding as many of the playthings as possible near\\nher mother’s chair, and was distinctly unimpressed if other children\\ncame along to purloin one for themselves. She even took a ball\\ndirectly from another child to add to her collection. This is typical\\nbehavior for children two and younger. Their ability to reciprocate,\\nwhile hardly absent (and able to manifest itself in truly endearing\\nways), is developmentally limited.\\n\\nBy three years of age, however, most children are capable of truly\\nsharing. They can delay gratification long enough to take their turn\\nwhile playing a game that everyone cannot play simultaneously. They\\ncan begin to understand the point of a game played by several people\\nand follow the rules, although they may not be able to give a coherent\\nverbal account of what those rules are. They start to form friendships\\nupon repeated exposure to children with whom they have\\nsuccessfully negotiated reciprocal play relationships. Some of these\\nfriendships turn into the first intense relationships that children\\nhave outside their family. It is in the context of such relationships,\\nwhich tend strongly to form between equals in age (or at least equals\\nin developmental stage), that a child learns to bond tightly to a peer\\nand starts to learn how to treat another person properly while\\nrequiring the same in return.\\n\\nThis mutual bonding is vitally important. A child without at least\\n\\none special, close friend is much more likely to suffer later\\npsychological problems, whether of the depressive/anxious or\\nantisocial sort,7 while children with fewer friends are also more likely\\n\\n\\x0cto be unemployed and unmarried as adults.8 There is no evidence\\nthat the importance of friendship declines in any manner with age.*\\nAll causes of mortality appear to be reduced among adults with high-\\nquality social networks, even when general health status is taken into\\nconsideration. This remains true among the elderly in the case of\\ndiseases such as hypertension, diabetes, emphysema, and arthritis,\\nand for younger and older adults alike in the case of heart attacks.\\nInterestingly enough, there is some evidence that it is the provision\\nof social support, as much or more than its receipt, that provides\\nthese protective benefits (and, somewhat unsurprisingly, that those\\nwho give more tend to receive more).9 Thus, it truly seems that it is\\nbetter to give than to receive.\\n\\nPeers distribute both the burdens and joys of life. Recently, when\\n\\nmy wife, Tammy, and I suffered serious health problems, we were\\nfortunate enough to have family members (my in-laws, sister and\\nbrother; my own mother and sister; our children) and close friends\\nstay with us and help for substantial periods of time. They were\\nwilling to put their own lives on hold to aid us while we were in crisis.\\nBefore that, when my book 12 Rules for Life became a success, and\\nduring the extensive speaking tour that followed, Tammy and I were\\nclose to people with whom we could share our good fortune. These\\nwere friends and family members genuinely pleased with what was\\nhappening and following the events of our lives avidly, and who were\\nwilling to discuss what could have been the overwhelming public\\nresponse. This greatly heightened the significance and meaning of\\neverything we were doing and reduced the isolation that such a\\ndramatic shift in life circumstances, for better or worse, is likely to\\nproduce.\\n\\nThe relationships established with colleagues of similar status at\\n\\nwork constitute another important source of peer regulation, in\\naddition to friendship. To maintain good relationships with your\\ncolleagues means, among other things, to give credit where credit is\\ndue; to take your fair share of the jobs no one wants but still must be\\ndone; to deliver on time and in a high-quality manner when teamed\\nwith other people; to show up when expected; and, in general, to be\\ntrusted to do somewhat more than your job formally requires. The\\napproval or disapproval of your colleagues rewards and enforces this\\ncontinual reciprocity, and that—like the reciprocity that is\\nnecessarily part of friendship—helps maintain stable psychological\\n\\n\\x0cfunction. It is much better to be someone who can be relied upon,\\nnot least so that during times of personal trouble the people you have\\nworked beside are willing and able to step in and help.\\n\\nThrough friendship and collegial relationships we modify our\\nselfish proclivities, learning not to always put ourselves first. Less\\nobviously, but just as importantly, we may also learn to overcome\\nour naive and too empathic proclivities (our tendency to sacrifice\\nourselves unsuitably and unjustly to predatory others) when our\\npeers advise and encourage us to stand up for ourselves. In\\nconsequence, if we are fortunate, we begin to practice true\\nreciprocity, and we gain at least some of the advantage spoken about\\nso famously by the poet Robert Burns:\\n\\nO wad some Pow’r the giftie gie us\\nTo see oursels as ithers see us!\\nIt wad frae mony a blunder free us,\\nAn’ foolish notion:\\nWhat airs in dress an’ gait wad lea’e us,\\nAn’ ev’n devotion!10\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIt is a good thing to be an authority. People are fragile. Because of\\nthat, life is difficult and suffering common. Ameliorating that\\nsuffering—ensuring that everyone has food, clean water, sanitary\\nfacilities, and a place to take shelter, for starters—takes initiative,\\neffort, and ability. If there is a problem to be solved, and many\\npeople involve themselves in the solution, then a hierarchy must and\\nwill arise, as those who can do, and those who cannot follow as best\\nthey can, often learning to be competent in the process. If the\\nproblem is real, then the people who are best at solving the problem\\nat hand should rise to the top. That is not power. It is the authority\\nthat properly accompanies ability.\\n\\nNow, it is self-evidently appropriate to grant power to competent\\nauthorities, if they are solving necessary problems; and it is equally\\nappropriate to be one of those competent authorities, if possible,\\nwhen there is a perplexing problem at hand. This might be regarded\\n\\n\\x0cas a philosophy of responsibility. A responsible person decides to\\nmake a problem his or her problem, and then works diligently—even\\nambitiously—for its solution, with other people, in the most efficient\\nmanner possible (efficient, because there are other problems to\\nsolve, and efficiency allows for the conservation of resources that\\nmight then be devoted importantly elsewhere).\\n\\nAmbition is often—and often purposefully—misidentified with the\\ndesire for power, and damned with faint praise, and denigrated, and\\npunished. And ambition is sometimes exactly that wish for undue\\ninfluence on others. But there is a crucial difference between\\nsometimes and always. Authority is not mere power, and it is\\nextremely unhelpful, even dangerous, to confuse the two. When\\npeople exert power over others, they compel them, forcefully. They\\napply the threat of privation or punishment so their subordinates\\nhave little choice but to act in a manner contrary to their personal\\nneeds, desires, and values. When people wield authority, by contrast,\\nthey do so because of their competence—a competence that is\\nspontaneously recognized and appreciated by others, and generally\\nfollowed willingly, with a certain relief, and with the sense that\\njustice is being served.\\n\\nThose who are power hungry—tyrannical and cruel, even\\n\\npsychopathic—desire control over others so that every selfish whim\\nof hedonism can be immediately gratified; so that envy can destroy\\nits target; so that resentment can find its expression. But good people\\nare ambitious (and diligent, honest, and focused along with it)\\ninstead because they are possessed by the desire to solve genuine,\\nserious problems. That variant of ambition needs to be encouraged\\nin every possible manner. It is for this reason, among many others,\\nthat the increasingly reflexive identification of the striving of boys\\nand men for victory with the “patriarchal tyranny” that\\nhypothetically characterizes our modern, productive, and\\ncomparatively free societies is so stunningly counterproductive (and,\\nit must be said, cruel: there is almost nothing worse than treating\\nsomeone striving for competence as a tyrant in training). “Victory,”\\nin one of its primary and most socially important aspects, is the\\novercoming of obstacles for the broader public good. Someone who is\\nsophisticated as a winner wins in a manner that improves the game\\nitself, for all the players. To adopt an attitude of naive or willfully\\nblind cynicism about this, or to deny outright that it is true, is to\\n\\n\\x0cposition yourself—perhaps purposefully, as people have many dark\\nmotives—as an enemy of the practical amelioration of suffering itself.\\nI can think of few more sadistic attitudes.\\n\\nNow, power may accompany authority, and perhaps it must.\\nHowever, and more important, genuine authority constrains the\\narbitrary exercise of power. This constraint manifests itself when\\nthe authoritative agent cares, and takes responsibility, for those over\\nwhom the exertion of power is possible. The oldest child can take\\naccountability for his younger siblings, instead of domineering over\\nand teasing and torturing them, and can learn in that manner how to\\nexercise authority and limit the misuse of power. Even the youngest\\ncan exercise appropriate authority over the family dog. To adopt\\nauthority is to learn that power requires concern and competence—\\nand that it comes at a genuine cost. Someone newly promoted to a\\nmanagement position soon learns that managers are frequently more\\nstressed by their multiple subordinates than subordinates are\\nstressed by their single manager. Such experience moderates what\\nmight otherwise become romantic but dangerous fantasies about the\\nattractiveness of power, and helps quell the desire for its infinite\\nextension. And, in the real world, those who occupy positions of\\nauthority in functional hierarchies are generally struck to the core by\\nthe responsibility they bear for the people they supervise, employ,\\nand mentor.\\n\\nNot everyone feels this burden, of course. A person who has\\nbecome established as an authority can forget his origins and come\\nto develop a counterproductive contempt for the person who is just\\nstarting out. This is a mistake, not least because it means that the\\nestablished person cannot risk doing something new (as it would\\nmean adopting the role of despised fool). It is also because arrogance\\nbars the path to learning. Shortsighted, willfully blind, and narrowly\\nselfish tyrants certainly exist, but they are by no means in the\\nmajority, at least in functional societies. Otherwise nothing would\\nwork.\\n\\nThe authority who remembers his or her sojourn as voluntary\\n\\nbeginner, by contrast, can retain their identification with the\\nnewcomer and the promise of potential, and use that memory as the\\nsource of personal information necessary to constrain the hunger for\\npower. One of the things that has constantly amazed me is the\\ndelight that decent people take in the ability to provide opportunities\\n\\n\\x0cto those over whom they currently exercise authority. I have\\nexperienced this repeatedly: personally, as a university professor and\\nresearcher (and observed many other people in my situation doing\\nthe same); and in the business and other professional settings I have\\nbecome familiar with. There is great intrinsic pleasure in helping\\nalready competent and admirable young people become highly\\nskilled, socially valuable, autonomous, responsible professionals. It\\nis not unlike the pleasure taken in raising children, and it is one of\\nthe primary motivators of valid ambition. Thus, the position of top\\ndog, when occupied properly, has as one of its fundamental\\nattractions the opportunity to identify deserving individuals at or\\nnear the beginning of their professional life, and provide them with\\nthe means of productive advancement.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00—\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nSanity is knowing the rules of the social game, internalizing them,\\nand following them. Differences in status are therefore inevitable, as\\nall worthwhile endeavors have a goal, and those who pursue them\\nhave different abilities in relationship to that goal. Accepting the fact\\nof this disequilibrium and striving forward nonetheless—whether\\npresently at the bottom, middle, or top—is an important element of\\nmental health. But a paradox remains. The solutions of yesterday\\nand today, upon which our current hierarchies depend, will not\\nnecessarily serve as solutions tomorrow. Thoughtless repetition of\\nwhat sufficed in the past—or, worse, authoritarian insistence that all\\nproblems have been permanently solved—therefore means the\\nintroduction of great danger when changes in the broader world\\nmakes local change necessary. Respect for creative transformation\\nmust in consequence accompany appropriate regard for the\\nproblem-solving hierarchical structures bequeathed to us by the past.\\nThat is neither an arbitrary moral opinion nor a morally relative\\nclaim. It is something more akin to knowledge of twin natural laws\\nbuilt into the structure of our reality. Highly social creatures such as\\nwe are must abide by the rules, to remain sane and minimize\\nunnecessary uncertainty, suffering, and strife. However, we must\\n\\n\\x0calso transform those rules carefully, as circumstances change around\\nus.\\n\\nThis implies, as well, that the ideal personality cannot remain an\\n\\nunquestioning reflection of the current social state. Under normal\\nconditions, it may be nonetheless said that the ability to conform\\nunquestioningly trumps the inability to conform. However, the\\nrefusal to conform when the social surround has become\\npathological—incomplete, archaic, willfully blind, or corrupt—is\\nsomething of even higher value, as is the capacity to offer creative,\\nvalid alternatives. This leaves all of us with a permanent moral\\nconundrum: When do we simply follow convention, doing what\\nothers request or demand; and when do we rely on our own\\nindividual judgment, with all its limitations and biases, and reject the\\nrequirements of the collective? In other words: How do we establish\\na balance between reasonable conservatism and revitalizing\\ncreativity?\\n\\nFirst and foremost on the psychological front is the issue of\\ntemperament. Some people are temperamentally predisposed to\\nconservatism, and others to more liberal creative perception and\\naction.11 This does not mean that socialization has no ability to alter\\nthat predisposition; human beings are very plastic organisms, with a\\nlong period of preadult development, and the circumstances we find\\nourselves in can change us very drastically. That does not alter the\\nfact, however, that there are relatively permanent niches in the\\nhuman environment to which different modes of temperament have\\nadapted to fill.\\n\\nThose who tend toward the right, politically, are staunch\\n\\ndefenders of all that has worked in the past. And much of the time,\\nthey are correct in being so, because of the limited number of\\npathways that produce personal success, social harmony, and long-\\nterm stability. But sometimes they are wrong: first, because the\\npresent and the future differ from the past; second, because even\\nonce-functional hierarchies typically (inevitably?) fall prey to\\ninternal machinations in a manner that produces their downfall.\\nThose who rise to the top can do so through manipulation and the\\nexercise of unjust power, acting in a manner that works only for\\nthem, at least in the short term; but that kind of ascendance\\nundermines the proper function of the hierarchy they are nominally\\npart of. Such people generally fail to understand or do not care what\\n\\n\\x0cfunction the organization they have made their host was designed to\\nfulfill. They extract what they can from the riches that lie before them\\nand leave a trail of wreckage in their wake.\\n\\nIt is this corruption of power that is strongly objected to by those\\non the liberal/left side of the political spectrum, and rightly so. But it\\nis critically important to distinguish between a hierarchy that is\\nfunctional and productive (and the people who make it so) and the\\ndegenerate shell of a once-great institution. Making that distinction\\nrequires the capacity and the willingness to observe and\\ndifferentiate, rather than mindless reliance on ideological proclivity.\\nIt requires knowing that there is a bright side to the social\\nhierarchies we necessarily inhabit, as well as a dark (and the\\nrealization that concentrating on one to the exclusion of the other is\\ndangerously biased). It also requires knowledge that on the more\\nradical, creative side—the necessary source of revitalization for what\\nhas become immoral and outdated—there also lurks great danger.\\nPart of the danger is that very tendency of those who think more\\nliberally to see only the negative in well-founded institutions. The\\nfurther danger stems from the counterpart to the corrupt but\\nconservative processes that destabilize and destroy functional\\nhierarchies: there are unethical radicals, just as there are crooked\\nadministrators, managers, and executives. These individuals tend to\\nbe profoundly ignorant of the complex realities of the status quo,\\nunconscious of their own ignorance, and ungrateful for what the past\\nhas bequeathed to them. Such ignorance and ingratitude are often\\nconjoined with the willingness to use tired clichés of cynicism to\\njustify refusal to engage either in the dull but necessary rigors of\\nconvention or the risks and difficulties of truly generative endeavor.\\nIt is this corruption of creative transformation that renders the\\nconservative—and not only the conservative—appropriately cautious\\nof change.\\n\\nA few years before writing this, I had a discussion with a young\\nwoman in her early twenties—the niece of someone who emailed me\\nafter watching some of my online lectures. She appeared severely\\nunhappy, and said that she had spent much of the past six months\\nlying in bed. She came to talk to me because she was becoming\\ndesperate. The only thing that stood between her and suicide, as far\\nas she was concerned, was the responsibility she still maintained for\\nan exotic pet, a serval cat. This was the last remaining manifestation\\n\\n\\x0cof an interest in biology that once gripped her, but which she\\nabandoned, much to her current regret, when she dropped out of\\nhigh school. She had not been well attended to by her parents, who\\nhad allowed her to drift in the manner that had become disastrous\\nover the span of several years.\\n\\nDespite her decline, she had formulated a bit of a plan. She said\\nshe had thought about enrolling in a two-year program that would\\nenable her to finish high school, as a prerequisite for applying to a\\nveterinary college. But she had not made the necessary detailed\\ninquiries into what would be required to carry out this ambition. She\\nlacked a mentor. She had no good friends. It was far too easy for her\\nto remain inactive and disappear into her isolation. We had a good\\nconversation, for about three quarters of an hour. She was a nice kid.\\nI offered to discuss her future in more detail if she would complete\\nan online planning program designed by my professorial colleagues\\nand me.*\\n\\nAll was going well until the discussion twisted toward the political.\\n\\nAfter discussing her personal situation, she began to voice her\\ndiscontent with the state of the world at large—with the looming\\ncatastrophe, in her opinion, of the effects of human activity on the\\nenvironment. Now, there is nothing wrong, in principle, with the\\nexpression of concern for planet-wide issues. That is not the point.\\nThere is something wrong, however, with overestimating your\\nknowledge of such things—or perhaps even considering them—when\\nyou are a mid-twenty-year-old with nothing positive going on in your\\nlife and you are having great difficulty even getting out of bed. Under\\nthose conditions, you need to get your priorities straight, and\\nestablishing the humility necessary to attend to and solve your own\\nproblems is a crucial part of doing just that.\\n\\nAs the verbal exchange continued, I found myself no longer\\n\\nengaged in a genuine conversation with a lost young woman who had\\ncome to speak with me. Instead, I became a hypothetically equal\\npartner in a debate with an ideologue who knew what was wrong,\\nglobally speaking; who knew who was at fault for those global\\nproblems; who knew that participating in the continuing destruction\\nby manifesting any personal desire whatsoever was immoral; and\\nwho believed, finally, that we were all both guilty and doomed.\\nContinuing the conversation at that point meant I was (1) speaking\\nnot with this young woman so much as with whatever or whomever\\n\\n\\x0ctook possession of her while in the grip of generic, impersonal, and\\ncynical ideas, and (2) implying that discussion of such topics under\\nthe circumstances was both acceptable and productive.\\n\\nThere was no point in either outcome. So, I stopped (which did not\\n\\nmean that the entire meeting had been a waste). It was impossible\\nfor me not to conclude that some of what had reduced her to her\\nmonthslong state of moral paralysis was not so much guilt about\\npotentially contributing to the negative effects of human striving on\\nthe broader world, as it was the sense of moral superiority that\\nconcern about such things brought her (despite the exceptional\\npsychological danger of embracing this dismal view of human\\npossibility). Excuse the cliché, but it is necessary to walk before you\\ncan run. You may even have to crawl before you can walk. This is\\npart of accepting your position as a beginner, at the bottom of the\\nhierarchy you so casually, arrogantly, and self-servingly despise.\\nFurthermore, the deeply antihuman attitude that often accompanies\\ntears shed for environmental degradation and man’s inhumanity to\\nman cannot but help but have a marked effect on the psychological\\nattitude that defines a person’s relationship to him or herself.\\n\\nIt has taken since time immemorial for us to organize ourselves,\\n\\nbiologically and socially, into the functional hierarchies that both\\nspecify our perceptions and actions, and define our interactions with\\nthe natural and social world. Profound gratitude for that gift is the\\nonly proper response. The structure that encompasses us all has its\\ndark side—just as nature does, just as each individual does—but that\\ndoes not mean careless, generic, and self-serving criticism of the\\nstatus quo is appropriate (any more than knee-jerk objection to what\\nmight be necessary change).\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nBecause doing what others do and have always done so often works,\\nand because, sometimes, radical action can produce success beyond\\nmeasure, the conservative and the creative attitudes and actions\\nconstantly propagate themselves. A functional social institution—a\\nhierarchy devoted to producing something of value, beyond the mere\\ninsurance of its own survival—can utilize the conservative types to\\ncarefully implement processes of tried-and-true value, and the\\n\\n\\x0ccreative, liberal types to determine how what is old and out of date\\nmight be replaced by something new and more valuable. The balance\\nbetween conservatism and originality might therefore be properly\\nstruck, socially, by bringing the two types of persons together. But\\nsomeone must determine how best to do that, and that requires a\\nwisdom that transcends mere temperamental proclivity. Because the\\ntraits associated with creativity, on the one hand, and comfort with\\nthe status quo, on the other, tend to be mutually exclusive, it is\\ndifficult to find a single person who has balanced both properly, who\\nis therefore comfortable working with each type, and who can attend,\\nin an unbiased manner, to the necessity for capitalizing on the\\nrespective forms of talent and proclivity. But the development of that\\nability can at least begin with an expansion of conscious wisdom: the\\narticulated realization that conservatism is good (with a set of\\nassociated dangers), and that creative transformation—even of the\\nradical sort—is also good (with a set of associated dangers). Learning\\nthis deeply—truly appreciating the need for both viewpoints—means\\nat least the possibility of valuing what truly diverse people have to\\noffer, and of being able to recognize when the balance has swung too\\nfar in one direction. The same is true of the knowledge of the shadow\\nside of both. To manage complex affairs properly, it is necessary to\\nbe cold enough in vision to separate the power hungry and self-\\nserving pseudoadvocate of the status quo from the genuine\\nconservative; and the self-deceptive, irresponsible rebel without a\\ncause from the truly creative. And to manage this means to separate\\nthose factors within the confines of one’s own soul, as well as among\\nother people.\\n\\nAnd how might this be accomplished? First, we might come to\\nunderstand consciously that these two modes of being are integrally\\ninterdependent. One cannot truly exist without the other, although\\nthey exist in genuine tension. This means, first, for example, that\\ndiscipline—subordination to the status quo, in one form or another—\\nneeds to be understood as a necessary precursor to creative\\ntransformation, rather than its enemy. Thus, just as the hierarchy of\\nassumptions that make up the structure that organizes society and\\nindividual perceptions is shaped by, and integrally dependent on,\\nrestrictions, so too is creative transformation. It must strain against\\nlimits. It has no use and cannot be called forth unless it is struggling\\nagainst something. It is for this reason that the great genie, the\\n\\n\\x0cgranter of wishes—God, in a microcosm—is archetypally trapped in\\nthe tiny confines of a lamp and subject, as well, to the will of the\\nlamp’s current holder. Genie—genius—is the combination of\\npossibility and potential, and extreme constraint.\\n\\nLimitations, constraints, arbitrary boundaries—rules, dread rules,\\n\\nthemselves—therefore not only ensure social harmony and\\npsychological stability, they make the creativity that renews order\\npossible. What lurks, therefore, under the explicitly stated desire for\\ncomplete freedom—as expressed, say, by the anarchist, or the nihilist\\n—is not a positive desire, striving for enhanced creative expression,\\nas in the romanticized caricature of the artist. It is instead a negative\\ndesire—a desire for the complete absence of responsibility, which is\\nsimply not commensurate with genuine freedom. This is the lie of\\nobjections to the rules. But “Down with Responsibility” does not\\nmake for a compelling slogan—being sufficiently narcissistic to\\nnegate itself self-evidently—while the corresponding “Down with the\\nRules” can be dressed up like a heroic corpse.\\n\\nAlongside the wisdom of true conservatism is the danger that the\\n\\nstatus quo might become corrupt and its corruption self-servingly\\nexploited. Alongside the brilliance of creative endeavor is the false\\nheroism of the resentful ideologue, who wears the clothes of the\\noriginal rebel while undeservedly claiming the upper moral hand and\\nrejecting all genuine responsibility. Intelligent and cautious\\nconservatism and careful and incisive change keep the world in\\norder. But each has its dark aspect, and it is crucial, once this has\\nbeen realized, to pose the question to yourself: Are you the real thing,\\nor its opposite? And the answer is, inevitably, that you are some of\\nboth—and perhaps far more of what is shadowy than you might like\\nto realize. That is all part of understanding the complexity we each\\ncarry within us.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00—\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nHow, then, is the personality that balances respect for social\\ninstitutions and, equally, creative transformation to be understood?\\nIt is not so easy to determine, given the complexity of the problem.\\n\\n\\x0cFor that reason, we turn to stories. Stories provide us with a broad\\ntemplate. They outline a pattern specific enough to be of tremendous\\nvalue, if we can imitate it, but general enough (unlike a particular\\nrule or set of rules) to apply even to new situations. In stories, we\\ncapture observations of the ideal personality. We tell tales about\\nsuccess and failure in adventure and romance. Across our narrative\\nuniverses, success moves us forward to what is better, to the\\npromised land; failure dooms us, and those who become entangled\\nwith us, to the abyss. The good moves us upward and ahead, and evil\\ndrags us backward and down. Great stories are about characters in\\naction, and so they mirror the unconscious structures and processes\\nthat help us translate the intransigent world of facts into the\\nsustainable, functional, reciprocal social world of values.*\\n\\nThe properly embodied hierarchy of values—including the value of\\n\\nconservatism and its twin, creative transformation—finds its\\nexpression as a personality, in narrative—an ideal personality. Every\\nhierarchy has something at its pinnacle. It is for this reason that a\\nstory, which is a description of the action of a personality, has a hero\\n(and even if that someone is the antihero, it does not matter: the\\nantihero serves the function of identifying the hero through contrast,\\nas the hero is what the antihero is most decidedly not). The hero is\\nthe individual at the peak, the victor, the champion, the wit, the\\neventually successful and deserving underdog, the speaker of truth\\nunder perilous circumstances, and more. The stories we create,\\nwatch, listen to, and remember center themselves on actions and\\nattitudes we find interesting, compelling, and worthy of\\ncommunication as a consequence of our personal experience with\\nboth admirable and detestable people (or fragments of their specific\\nattitudes and actions), or because of our proclivity to share what has\\ngripped our attention with those who surround us. Sometimes we\\ncan draw compelling narratives directly from our personal\\nexperience with individual people; sometimes we create amalgams of\\nmultiple personalities, often in concert with those who compose our\\nsocial groups.\\n\\nThe client whose story was told in part earlier had a life usefully\\nemployed as an example of the necessity of social engagement. That\\ntale did not, however, exhaust the significance of his transformed\\nattitudes and actions. While he was reconstructing his social life,\\nbecoming an active participant in a range of collective activities, he\\n\\n\\x0csimultaneously developed a certain creative expertise that was\\nequally unexpected. He had not benefited from formal education\\nbeyond the high school level, and did not have a personality that\\nimmediately struck the external observer as markedly creative.\\nHowever, the personally novel social pursuits that attracted him\\nwere in the main oriented toward aesthetic endeavor.\\n\\nHe first developed his eye for form, symmetry, novelty, and beauty\\n\\nas a photographer. The social advantages of this pursuit were\\nmanifold: he joined a club that had its members attend biweekly\\nphotography walks, where they would sojourn as a group of twenty\\nor so to parts of the city that were visually interesting, either for their\\nnatural beauty or uniqueness or for the attraction they held as\\nindustrial landscapes. He learned a fair bit about photographic\\nequipment, technically, because of doing so. The group members\\nalso critiqued one another’s work—and they did this constructively,\\nwhich meant that all of them appeared to indicate what errors had\\nbeen made but also what of value had been managed.\\n\\nThis all helped my client learn to communicate in a productive\\nmanner about topics that might otherwise have been psychologically\\ndifficult (touching as they did on criticisms that, because of their\\nassociation with creative vision, could easily have generated\\ncounterproductively sensitive overreactions) and, as well, to\\nincreasingly distinguish between visual images that were trite or dull\\nor conformist and those of genuine quality. After a few months, his\\nperception had developed sufficiently so that he began to win local\\ncontests and generate small professional commissions. I had\\nbelieved from the beginning that his participation in the\\nphotography club was well advised from the perspective of\\npersonality development, but I was genuinely struck by the rapid\\ndevelopment of his visual and technical ability and very much\\nenjoyed the times we spent in our sessions reviewing his work.\\n\\nAfter a few months of work on the photography front, my client\\nbegan to produce and to show me other images he had created, as\\nwell—which were in their first incarnation decidedly amateurish\\nabstract line drawings done in pen. These essentially consisted of\\nloops of various sizes, joined continuously, on a single page:\\nscribbles, really, although more controlled and evidently purposeful\\nthan mere scribbles. As I had with the photographs (and the\\nphotography club), I regarded these as psychologically useful—as an\\n\\n\\x0cextension of creative ability—but not as worthwhile artistic\\nendeavors in their own right. He kept at it, however, generating\\nseveral drawings a week, all the while bringing what he had created\\nto our sessions. What he produced increased in sophistication and\\nbeauty with dramatic rapidity. Soon, he was drawing complex,\\nsymmetrical, and rather dramatic black-and-white pen-and-ink\\ndrawings of sufficient intrinsic beauty to serve as commercially\\nviable T-shirt designs.\\n\\nI had seen this sort of development clearly in the case of two other\\n\\nclients, both characterized by intrinsically creative temperaments\\n(very well hidden in one of the cases; more developed, nurtured, and\\nobvious in the other). In addition, I had read accounts of clinical\\ncases and personal development by Carl Jung, who noted that the\\nproduction of increasingly ordered and complex geometrical figures\\n—often circles within squares, or the reverse—regularly accompanied\\nan increase in organization of the personality. This certainly seemed\\ntrue not only of my client, as evidenced by his burgeoning expertise\\nat photography and the development of his skill as a graphic artist,\\nbut also of the two others I had the pleasure of serving as a clinical\\ntherapist. What I observed repeatedly was, therefore, not only the\\nreconstruction of the psyche as a consequence of further socialization\\n(and the valuation of social institutions) but the parallel\\ntransformation of primarily interior processes, indicated by a\\nmarked increase in the capacity to perceive and to create what was\\nelegant, beautiful, and socially valued. My clients had learned not\\nonly to submit properly to the sometimes arbitrary but still necessary\\ndemands of the social world, but to offer to that world something it\\nwould not have had access to had it not been for their private\\ncreative work.\\n\\nMy granddaughter, Scarlett, also came to exhibit behaviors that\\n\\nwere indicative of, if not her creative ability, then at least her\\nappreciation for creative ability, in addition to her socialization as an\\nagent of socially valued pointing. When people discuss a story—\\npresented as a movie, or a play, or a book—they commonly attempt\\nto come to a sophisticated consensus about its point (sophisticated\\nbecause a group of people can generally offer more viewpoints than a\\nsingle individual; consensus because the discussion usually\\ncontinues until some broad agreement is reached as to the topic at\\nhand). Now, the idea that a story is a form of communication—and\\n\\n\\x0centertainment—is one of those facts that appears self-evident upon\\nfirst consideration, but that becomes more mysterious the longer it is\\npondered. If it is true that a story has a point, then it is clear that it is\\npointing to something. But what, and how? What constitutes\\npointing is obvious when it is an action specifying a particular thing,\\nor a person by a particular person, but much less obvious when it is\\nsomething typifying the cumulative behavior, shall we say, of a\\ncharacter in a story.\\n\\nThe actions and attitudes of J. K. Rowling’s heroes and heroines\\nonce again provide popular examples of precisely this process. Harry\\nPotter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger are typified in large\\npart by the willingness and ability to follow rules (indicating their\\nexpertise as apprentices) and, simultaneously, to break them. While\\nthose who supervise them are inclined, equally, to reward both\\napparently paradoxical forms of behavior. Even the technologies\\nused by the young wizards during their apprenticeship are\\ncharacterized by this duality. The Marauder’s Map, for example\\n(which provides its bearer with an accurate representation of\\nexplored territory in the form of the physical layout or geography of\\nHogwarts, the wizarding school, as well as the locale of all its living\\ndenizens), can be activated as a functional tool only by uttering a set\\nof words that seem to indicate the very opposite of moral behavior: “I\\nsolemnly swear that I am up to no good,” and deactivated, so that its\\nfunction remains secret, with the phrase “Mischief managed.”\\n\\nIt is no easy matter to understand how an artifact that requires\\nsuch statements to make it usable could possibly be anything but “no\\ngood”—a tool of evil purpose, apparently. But, like the fact that Harry\\nand his friends regularly but carefully break rules, and are equally\\nregularly and carefully rewarded for doing so, the Marauder’s Map\\nvaries in its ethical desirability with the intent of its users. There is a\\nstrong implication throughout the series that what is good cannot be\\nsimply encapsulated by mindless or rigid rule following, no matter\\nhow disciplined that following, or how vital the rules so followed.\\nWhat this all means is that the Harry Potter series does not point to\\ndrone-like subservience to social order as the highest of moral\\nvirtues. What supersedes that obedience is not so obvious that it can\\nbe easily articulated, but it is something like “Follow rules except\\nwhen doing so undermines the purpose of those selfsame rules—in\\nwhich case take the risk of acting in a manner contrary to what has\\n\\n\\x0cbeen agreed upon as moral.” This is a lesson that seems more easily\\ntaught by representations of the behaviors that embody it than\\ntransmitted by, say, rote learning or a variant rule. Meta-rules\\n(which might be regarded as rules about rules, rather than rules\\nthemselves) are not necessarily communicated in the same manner\\nas simple rules themselves.\\n\\nScarlett, with her emphasis on pointing, learned soon after\\n\\nmastering the comparatively straightforward physical act, to grasp\\nthe more complex point of narratives. She could signify something\\nwith her index finger at the age of a year and a half. By two and a half\\nyears, however, she could understand and imitate the far more\\nintricate point of a story. For a period of approximately six months,\\nat the latter age, she would insist, when asked, that she was\\nPocahontas, rather than Ellie (the name preferred by her father) or\\nScarlett (preferred by her mother). This was a staggering act of\\nsophisticated thought, as far as I was concerned. She had been given\\na Pocahontas doll, which became one of her favorite toys, along with\\na baby doll (also very well loved), who she named after her\\ngrandmother, my wife, Tammy. When she played with the infant\\ndoll, Ellie was the mother. With Pocahontas, however, the situation\\ndiffered. That doll was not a baby, and Ellie was not its mother. My\\ngranddaughter regarded herself, instead, as the grown Pocahontas—\\nmimicking the doll, which was fashioned like a young woman, as well\\nas the character who served as the lead in the Disney movie of the\\nsame name, which she had raptly observed on two separate\\noccasions.\\n\\nThe Disney Pocahontas bore marked similarities to the main\\n\\nprotagonists of the Harry Potter series. She finds herself promised by\\nher father to Kocoum, a brave warrior who embodies, in all\\nseriousness, the virtues of his tribe, but whose behavior and attitudes\\nare too rule bound for the more expansive personality of his bride-to-\\nbe. Pocahontas falls in love, instead, with John Smith, captain of a\\nship from Europe and representative of that which falls outside of\\nknown territory but is (potentially) of great value. Paradoxically,\\nPocahontas is pursuing a higher moral order in rejecting Kocoum for\\nSmith—breaking a profoundly important rule (value what is most\\nvalued in the current culture’s hierarchy of rules)—very much in the\\nsame manner as the primary Potter characters. That is the moral of\\nboth narratives: follow the rules until you are capable of being a\\n\\n\\x0cshining exemplar of what they represent, but break them when those\\nvery rules now constitute the most dire impediment to the\\nembodiment of their central virtues. And Elizabeth Scarlett, not yet\\nthree years of age, had the intrinsic wisdom to see this as the point of\\nwhat she was watching (the Disney movie) and using as a role-\\nplaying aid (the doll Pocahontas). Her perspicacity in this regard\\nbordered on the unfathomable.\\n\\nThe same set of ideas—respect for the rules, except when following\\n\\nthose rules means disregarding or ignoring or remaining blind to an\\neven higher moral principle—is represented with stunning power in\\ntwo different Gospel narratives (which serve, regardless of your\\nopinion about them, as central traditional or classical stories\\nportraying a personality for the purposes of evoking imitation). In\\nthe first, Christ is presented, even as a child, as a master of the\\nJewish tradition. This makes him fully informed as to the value of the\\npast, and portrays him as characterized by the respect typical, say, of\\nthe genuine conservative. According to the account in Luke 2:42–\\n52,* Jesus’s family journeyed to Jerusalem every year at the Jewish\\nholiday of Passover:\\n\\nAnd when he was twelve years old, they went up to\\nJerusalem after the custom of the feast.\\n\\nAnd when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned,\\n\\nthe child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph\\nand his mother knew not of it.\\n\\nBut they, supposing him to have been in the company,\\n\\nwent a day’s journey; and they sought him among their\\nkinsfolk and acquaintance.\\n\\nAnd when they found him not, they turned back again to\\n\\nJerusalem, seeking him.\\n\\nAnd it came to pass, that after three days they found him\\n\\nin the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both\\nhearing them, and asking them questions.\\n\\nAnd all that heard him were astonished at his\\n\\nunderstanding and answers.\\n\\nAnd when they saw him, they were amazed: and his\\nmother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with\\nus? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me?\\nwist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?\\n\\nAnd they understood not the saying which he spake unto\\n\\nthem.\\n\\nAnd he went down with them, and came to Nazareth,\\nand was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these\\nsayings in her heart.\\n\\nAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in\\n\\nfavour with God and man.\\n\\nA paradox emerges, however, as the entirety of the Gospel\\naccounts are considered—one closely associated with the tension\\nbetween respect for tradition and the necessity for creative\\ntransformation. Despite the evidence of His thorough and even\\nprecocious understanding and appreciation of the rules, the adult\\nChrist repeatedly and scandalously violates the Sabbath traditions—\\nat least from the standpoint of the traditionalists in His community,\\nand much to His own peril. He leads His disciples through a\\ncornfield, for example, plucking and eating the grains (Luke 6:1). He\\njustifies this to the Pharisees who object by referring to an account of\\nKing David acting in a similar manner, feeding his people when\\nnecessity demanded it on bread that was reserved for the priests\\n(Luke 6:4). Christ tells his interlocutors quite remarkably “that the\\nSon of man is Lord also of the sabbath” (Luke 6:5).\\n\\nAn ancient document known as the Codex Bezae,* a noncanonical\\n\\nvariant of part of the New Testament, offers an interpolation just\\nafter the section of the Gospel of Luke presented above, shedding\\nprofound light on the same issue. It offers deeper insight into the\\ncomplex and paradoxical relationship between respect for the rules\\nand creative moral action that is necessary and desirable, despite\\nmanifesting itself in apparent opposition to those rules. It contains\\nan account of Christ addressing someone who, like Him, has broken\\na sacred rule: “On that same day, observing one working on the\\nSabbath, [Jesus] said to him O Man, if indeed thou knowest what\\nthou doest, thou art blest; but if thou knowest not, thou art accursed,\\nand a transgressor of the Law.”12\\n\\nWhat does this statement mean? It sums up the meaning of Rule I\\n\\nperfectly. If you understand the rules—their necessity, their\\n\\n\\x0csacredness, the chaos they keep at bay, how they unite the\\ncommunities that follow them, the price paid for their establishment,\\nand the danger of breaking them—but you are willing to fully\\nshoulder the responsibility of making an exception, because you see\\nthat as serving a higher good (and if you are a person with sufficient\\ncharacter to manage that distinction), then you have served the\\nspirit, rather than the mere law, and that is an elevated moral act.\\nBut if you refuse to realize the importance of the rules you are\\nviolating and act out of self-centered convenience, then you are\\nappropriately and inevitably damned. The carelessness you exhibit\\nwith regard to your own tradition will undo you and perhaps those\\naround you fully and painfully across time.\\n\\nThis is in keeping with other sentiments and acts of Christ\\ndescribed in the Gospels. Matthew 12:11 states: “And he said unto\\nthem, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one\\nsheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold\\non it, and lift it out?” Luke chapter 6 describes Him healing a man\\nwith a withered hand on another Sabbath, stating “It is lawful on the\\nSabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or destroy it?”\\n(Luke 6:9). This psychologically and conceptually painful\\njuxtaposition of two moral stances (the keeping of the Sabbath\\nversus the injunction to do good) is something else that constantly\\nenrages the Pharisees, and is part of the series of events that\\neventually leads to Christ’s arrest and Crucifixion. These stories\\nportray the existential dilemma that eternally characterizes human\\nlife: it is necessary to conform, to be disciplined, and to follow the\\nrules—to do humbly what others do; but it is also necessary to use\\njudgment, vision, and the truth that guides conscience to tell what is\\nright, when the rules suggest otherwise. It is the ability to manage\\nthis combination that truly characterizes the fully developed\\npersonality: the true hero.\\n\\nA certain amount of arbitrary rule-ness must be tolerated—or\\nwelcomed, depending on your point of view—to keep the world and\\nits inhabitants together. A certain amount of creativity and rebellion\\nmust be tolerated—or welcomed, depending on your point of view—\\nto maintain the process of regeneration. Every rule was once a\\ncreative act, breaking other rules. Every creative act, genuine in its\\ncreativity, is likely to transform itself, with time, into a useful rule. It\\nis the living interaction between social institutions and creative\\n\\n\\x0cachievement that keeps the world balanced on the narrow line\\nbetween too much order and too much chaos. This is a terrible\\nconundrum, a true existential burden. We must support and value\\nthe past, and we need to do that with an attitude of gratitude and\\nrespect. At the same time, however, we must keep our eyes open—\\nwe, the visionary living—and repair the ancient mechanisms that\\nstabilize and support us when they falter. Thus, we need to bear the\\nparadox that is involved in simultaneously respecting the walls that\\nkeep us safe and allowing in enough of what is new and changing so\\nthat our institutions remain alive and healthy. The very world\\ndepends for its stability and its dynamism on the subsuming of all\\nour endeavors under the perfection—the sacredness—of that dual\\nability.\\n\\nDo not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative\\n\\nachievement.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nIMAGINE WHO YOU COULD BE, AND THEN AIM\\nSINGLE-MINDEDLY AT THAT\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00—\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nHow do you know who you are? After all, you are complex beyond\\nyour own understanding; more complex than anything else that\\nexists, excepting other people; complex beyond belief. And your\\nignorance is further complicated by the intermingling of who you are\\nwith who you could be. You are not only something that is. You are\\nsomething that is becoming—and the potential extent of that\\nbecoming also transcends your understanding. Everyone has the\\nsense, I believe, that there is more to them than they have yet\\nallowed to be realized. That potential is often obscured by poor\\nhealth, misfortune, and the general tragedies and mishaps of life. But\\nit can also be hidden by an unwillingness to take full advantage of the\\nopportunities that life offers—abetted by regrettable errors of all\\nsorts, including failures of discipline, faith, imagination, and\\ncommitment. Who are you? And, more importantly, who could you\\nbe, if you were everything you could conceivably be?\\n\\nAre such questions impossible to answer, or are there sources\\navailable to us from which guidance might be derived? After all, we\\nhave been observing ourselves behave—in our successes and failures\\n—for tens (perhaps hundreds) of thousands of years. During that\\ntime, our shamans, prophets, mystics, artists, poets, and bards have\\ndistilled something vital from such observations—some concentrated\\nessence of what makes us human in actuality and possibility. In\\ndoing so, they have provided us with representations of that vital\\nessence, presenting itself to us as that which can be neither ignored\\n\\n\\x0cnor forgotten. Those creative people write and act out the dramas\\nand tell us the stories that capture our imagination, and they fill our\\ndreams with visions of what might be. The deepest and most\\nprofound of these are remembered, discussed, and otherwise honed\\ncollectively, and made the focus of rituals that unite us across the\\ncenturies, forming the very basis of our cultures. These are the\\nstories upon which the ritual, religious, and philosophical edifices\\ncharacterizing sophisticated, populous, successful societies are built.\\nThe stories we can neither ignore nor forget are unforgettable for\\nthis reason (among others): They speak to something we know, but\\ndo not know that we know. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates\\nbelieved that all learning was a form of remembering. Socrates\\nposited that the soul, immortal in its essence, knew everything before\\nit was born anew as an infant. However, at the point of birth all\\nprevious knowledge was forgotten and had to be recalled through the\\nexperiences of life. There is much to be said for this hypothesis,\\nstrange as it might now appear. There is much that we could do—\\nmuch that our bodies and minds are capable of doing—that remains\\ndormant, right down to the genetic level. Exposure to new experience\\nactivates this dormant potential, releasing abilities built into us over\\nthe vast span of our evolutionary history.1 This is perhaps the most\\nbasic manner in which our bodies retain past wisdom and draw upon\\nit when necessary. It is in this way, although not only in this way,\\nthat human possibility exists. Thus, there is something profound to\\nbe said for the concept of learning as remembering.\\n\\nObviously, as well as “remembering” (as in the turning on of\\n\\ninnate but hidden possibilities), we can learn much that is new. This\\nis one of the primary factors differentiating us from animals. Even\\ncomplex and intelligent mammals such as chimpanzees and dolphins\\ntend to repeat their species-typical behaviors generation after\\ngeneration, with very little change. Humans, by contrast, can and\\ncontinually do seek out and encounter what is new, investigate and\\nadapt to it, and make it part of themselves. We can, as well, translate\\nsomething we already know at one level of representation into\\nknowledge at another. We can watch the actions of a living creature,\\nanimal or human, and then imitate them, translating our perceptions\\nof their movement into new movements of our own. We can even\\ngeneralize such imitative acts, catching the “spirit” of what or whom\\nwe are observing, and producing new ways of seeing and acting that\\n\\n\\x0care in some manner similar to that spirit.* This is part of what makes\\nup the basis of the deeply embodied implicit knowledge that forms so\\nmuch of the basis of our true understanding. We can also observe\\nsomeone act or something occur and write down what we see,\\ntranslating action into language that outlasts its utterance—and then\\ncommunicate it later in the absence of what or whom is being\\ndescribed. Finally, and most mysteriously, we can imagine and then\\nact out something that has simply not been seen before, something\\nthat is truly original. And we can code and represent all that ability—\\nadaptive action and its transformation—in the stories we tell about\\nthose we admire, as well as those we hate. And that is how we\\ndetermine who we are, and who we could perhaps become.\\nStories become unforgettable when they communicate\\nsophisticated modes of being—complex problems and equally\\ncomplex solutions—that we perceive, consciously, in pieces, but\\ncannot fully articulate. It was for this reason, for example, that the\\nbiblical story of Moses and the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt became\\nsuch a powerful touchstone for black slaves seeking emancipation in\\nthe United States:\\n\\nGo down, Moses, way down in Egypt land\\n\\nTell old Pharaoh\\nTo let my people go.2\\n\\nThe biblical story of Exodus is properly regarded as archetypal (or\\n\\nparadigmatic or foundational) by psychoanalytic and religious\\nthinkers alike, because it presents an example of psychological and\\nsocial transformation that cannot be improved upon. It emerged as a\\nproduct of imagination and has been transformed by constant\\ncollective retelling and reworking into an ultimately meaningful form\\nthat applies politically, economically, historically, personally, and\\nspiritually, all at the same time. This is the very definition of literary\\ndepth—something that reaches its apogee in certain forms of ancient,\\ntraditional stories. The fact of that depth means that such accounts\\ncan be used diversely as a meaningful frame for any process of\\nprofound change experienced by any individual or society (stable\\nstate, descent into chaos, reestablishment of stability), and can lend\\n\\n\\x0cthat process multidimensional reality, context, powerful meaning,\\nand motivation.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nHow might an unforgettable story come to be? What might precede\\nits revelation? It is at the very least the consequence of a long period\\nof observation. Imagine a scientist monitoring the behavior of a wolf\\npack, or a troop of chimps—indeed, any group of complex social\\nanimals. He or she attempts to identify regularities in the behavior of\\nthe individuals and the group (patterns, in a word) and to articulate\\nthose regularities—to encapsulate them in language. The scientist\\nmight first relate a series of anecdotes about animal actions\\nemblematic of the general behavior of the species. He or she might\\nthen abstract even further, attempting to generalize across anecdotes\\nwith rule-like descriptions. I say “rule-like” because the animals are\\nnot following rules. Rules require language. Animals are merely\\nacting out regularities. They cannot formulate, understand, or follow\\nrules.\\n\\nBut human beings? We can observe ourselves acting, as a scientist\\n\\nmight—more accurately, as a storyteller might. Then we can tell the\\nstories to each other. The stories are already distillations of observed\\nbehavior (if they are not distillations, they will not be interesting;\\nrelating a sequence of everyday actions does not make for a good\\nstory). Once the story is established, we can analyze it, looking for\\ndeeper patterns and regularities. If that analysis is successful, we can\\ngeneralize across anecdotes with the formulation of rules, and then\\nwe can learn, consciously, to follow those rules. Here is how this\\nmight happen. We all react judgmentally when a child or adult—or,\\nindeed, a society—is acting improperly, unfairly, or badly. The error\\nstrikes us emotionally. We intuit that a pattern upon which\\nindividual and social adaptation depends has been disrupted and\\nviolated. We are annoyed, frustrated, hurt, or grief-stricken at the\\nbetrayal. This does not mean that each of us, reacting emotionally,\\nhas been successful at articulating a comprehensive philosophy of\\ngood and evil. We may never put our finger on what has gone wrong.\\nHowever, like children unfamiliar with a new game but still able to\\nplay it, we know that the rules are being broken.\\n\\n\\x0cSomething precisely like this is portrayed in the biblical story of\\nExodus, the ancient account of the flight of the Hebrew slaves from\\ntheir Egyptian masters. Moses, who leads the escaping people, is\\ncontinually called upon by his followers to draw very fine moral\\ndistinctions when they struggle with one another and seek his advice.\\nIn consequence, he spends a very long time observing and\\ncontemplating their behavior. It is as if the desert prophet had to\\ndiscover what rules he and his Israelite followers were already\\nstruggling to act out, prior to his receipt of the explicit\\ncommandments from God. Remember: Every society is already\\ncharacterized by patterned behavior; otherwise it would be pure\\nconflict and no “society” at all. But the mere fact that social order\\nreigns to some degree does not mean that a given society has come to\\nexplicitly understand its own behavior, its own moral code. It is\\ntherefore no accident that in this story Moses serves as a judge for\\nhis followers—and does so with sufficient duration and intensity to\\nexhaust himself—before he receives the Ten Commandments:\\n\\nAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge\\nthe people: and the people stood by Moses from the\\nmorning unto the evening.\\n\\nAnd when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the\\n\\npeople, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the\\npeople? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people\\nstand by thee from morning unto even?\\n\\nAnd Moses said unto his father in law, Because the\\n\\npeople come unto me to inquire of God:\\n\\nWhen they have a matter, they come unto me; and I\\njudge between one and another, and I do make them know\\nthe statutes of God, and his laws.\\n\\nAnd Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that\\n\\nthou doest is not good.\\n\\nThou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people\\nthat is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou\\nart not able to perform it thyself alone. (Exodus 18: 13–18)\\n\\nThis difficult exercise in discrimination and judgment, observing\\n\\nand weighing, is an integral part of what prepared the biblical\\n\\n\\x0cpatriarch for the receipt of divine revelation. If there had been no\\nbehavioral base for those rules—no historical precedent codified in\\ntraditional ethics, no conventions, and no endless hours of\\nobservation of the moral patterns—the commandments simply could\\nnot have been understood and communicated, much less obeyed.\\nAn unforgettable story captures the essence of humanity and\\ndistills, communicates, and clarifies it, bringing what we are and\\nwhat we should be into focus. It speaks to us, motivating the\\nattention that inspires us to imitate. We learn to see and act in the\\nmanner of the heroes of the stories that captivate us. These stories\\ncall to capacities that lie deep within our nature but might still never\\ndevelop without that call. We are dormant adventurers, lovers,\\nleaders, artists, and rebels, but need to discover that we are all those\\nthings by seeing the reflection of such patterns in dramatic and\\nliterary form. That is part of being a creature that is part nature and\\npart culture. An unforgettable story advances our capacity to\\nunderstand our behavior, beyond habit and expectation, toward an\\nimaginative and then verbalized understanding. Such a story\\npresents us in the most compelling manner with the ultimate\\nadventure, the divine romance, and the eternal battle between good\\nand evil. All this helps us clarify our understanding of moral and\\nimmoral attitude and action, personal and social. This can be seen\\neverywhere, and always.\\n\\nQuestion: Who are you—or, at least, who could you be? Answer:\\n\\nPart of the eternal force that constantly confronts the terrible\\nunknown, voluntarily; part of the eternal force that transcends\\nnaivete and becomes dangerous enough, in a controlled manner, to\\nunderstand evil and beard it in its lair; and part of the eternal force\\nthat faces chaos and turns it into productive order, or that takes\\norder that has become too restrictive, reduces it to chaos, and\\nrenders it productive once again.\\n\\nAnd all of this, being very difficult to understand consciously but\\nvital to our survival, is transmitted in the form of the stories that we\\ncannot help but attend to. And it is in this manner that we come to\\napprehend what is of value, what we should aim at, and what we\\ncould be.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI would like to try my hand at explaining the meaning of the\\nillustration, based on an ancient alchemical woodcut, that opens this\\nchapter. Describing what it signifies reveals how much information\\ncan be contained within an image without the viewer possessing any\\nexplicit understanding of its contents (such a picture is in fact better\\nconsidered an early stage in the process by which such explicit\\nunderstanding develops). The ancient alchemist* who produced the\\npicture was dreaming, in a very real sense, while doing so—dreaming\\nabout what a person could be, and how that might come about.\\n\\nAt the very base of the image is a winged sphere. Atop that perches\\n\\na dragon. Standing on the dragon is a two-headed human figure—\\none head male, the other female. The male head is associated with an\\nimage of the Sun; the female, with the Moon. In between but also\\nabove the two heads is the symbol for Mercury: god, planet, and\\nmetal, simultaneously. A variety of additional symbols round out the\\npicture. Everything portrayed is enveloped in an egg-shaped\\ncontainer. This arrangement indicates that the image is of many\\nthings inside one thing—a multiplicity in a unity—just as an\\nunhatched chick is encapsulated within a single container but is\\nmany increasingly differentiated and complex biological parts,\\nparticularly in its later stages of development. In its entirety, the\\nimage is labeled materia prima—Latin for the “primal element.”\\n\\nThe alchemists regarded the materia prima as the fundamental\\nsubstance from which everything else—matter and spirit included,\\nequally—emerged, or was derived. You can profitably consider that\\nprimal element the potential we face when we confront the future,\\nincluding our future selves—or the potential we cannot help\\nupbraiding ourselves and others for wasting. It can also be usefully\\nconceptualized as the information from which we build ourselves\\nand the world, instead of the matter out of which we generally\\nconsider reality composed. Each interpretation—potential and\\ninformation—has its advantages.\\n\\nWhat does it mean that the world can be usefully considered as\\npotential or information? Think about what happens, for example,\\nwhen you stop by the mailbox and pick up your mail. Consider, as\\nwell, what that mail is “made of.” Materially speaking, it is merely\\npaper and ink. But that material substrate is essentially irrelevant. It\\n\\n\\x0cwould not matter if the message was delivered by email or voice—or\\nin Morse code, for that matter. What is relevant is the content. And\\nthat means that each piece of mail is a container of content—of\\npotential or information, positive, neutral, or negative. Maybe, for\\nexample, it is a notification of investigation from your country’s tax\\ndepartment. This means that, despite its apparently harmless\\npresence in your hand, the letter is tightly and inextricably connected\\nto a gigantic, complex and oft-arbitrary structure that may well not\\nhave your best interests in mind. Alternatively, perhaps it is\\nsomething joyful, such as an unexpected letter from someone loved\\nor a long-awaited check. From such a perspective, an envelope is a\\ncontainer—a mysterious container, at least in potential—from which\\nan entire new world might emerge.\\n\\nEveryone understands this idea, even if they do not know it. If you\\n\\nhave been having trouble with the tax authorities, for example, and\\nyou receive an official piece of mail from their agency, your blood\\npressure will increase (or drop precipitously), your heart will pound,\\nyour palms will sweat, and a feeling of intense fear, even doom, may\\nsweep over you. That is the instinctive response, associated with\\npreparation for action, that accompanies exposure to danger. And\\nnow you will have to decide: are you going to open the letter and face\\nwhat is “inside”? And, having done so, are you going to think your\\nway through the problem, terrible as that might be, and begin to\\naddress it? Or are you going to ignore what you now know, pretend\\nthat everything is all right (even though you know, emotionally—as a\\nconsequence of your anxiety—that it is not), and pay the inevitable\\npsychological and physical price? It is the former route that will\\nrequire you to voluntarily confront what you are afraid of—the\\nterrible, abstract monster—and, hypothetically, to become stronger\\nand more integrated as a result. It is the latter route that will leave\\nthe problem in its monstrous form and force you to suffer like a\\nscared animal confronted by a predator’s vicious eyes in the pitch of\\nnight.\\n\\nA winged sphere, inscribed with a square, a triangle, and the\\n\\nnumerals 3 and 4 occupies the bottom third of the image in\\nquestion.* This singular entity or object was known by the alchemists\\nas the “round chaos.”3 It is a container—the initial container of the\\nprimordial element—the container of what the world, and the\\npsyche, consists of before it becomes differentiated. This is the\\n\\n\\x0cpotential, or information. This is what attracts your attention\\nunconsciously and compels you to attend to something before you\\nknow why it has gripped your interest. This is when and where what\\nis new makes its entrance into what is predictable and certain (for\\nbetter or worse); what flits about you, with little voluntary control—\\nas if it is something winged—as your imagination and your attention\\nmove unpredictably but meaningfully from association to\\nassociation; and it is what you are looking at when you have no idea\\nwhat it is you are confronting. Finally, it is what you cannot look\\naway from when you are possessed by horror, even as such potential\\nfor horror simultaneously adds vital interest to life.\\n\\nStrangely, the round chaos may be familiar to modern audiences\\n\\n(again, even if they do not know it), because of the Harry Potter\\nseries of books and films. J. K. Rowling, the series author, takes\\nsome pains to describe a sporting event, Quidditch, which helps to\\ndefine and unify Hogwarts. The point of Quidditch is to drive a ball\\n(the Quaffle) through one of the three hoops guarded by the\\nopposing team, while flying about the playing pitch on enchanted\\nbrooms. Success in doing so gains the scorer’s team 10 points.\\nSimultaneously, two separate players (one from each team) play\\nanother game—a game within the game. Chosen for their exceptional\\nskill in attention and flight, these two competitors—known as\\nSeekers—attempt to locate, chase, and capture a winged ball, the\\nSnitch, which is identical in appearance to the round chaos that sits\\nat the bottom of the alchemist’s image. The Snitch is golden—\\nindicating its exceptional value and purity*—and zips around\\nchaotically, at a very fast rate, darting, weaving, bobbing, and racing\\nthe Seekers as they pursue it astride their brooms. If a Seeker\\ncaptures the Snitch, his or her team gains 150 points (typically\\nenough to ensure victory) and the entire game comes to an end. This\\nindicates that chasing and capturing whatever is represented by the\\nSnitch—and, by implication, the round chaos—is a goal whose\\nimportance supersedes any other.* Why is Rowling’s game, conjured\\nup for us by her deep imagination, structured in that manner? What\\ndoes her narrative idea signify? There are two ways of answering\\nthese questions (although both answers relate importantly to each\\nother):\\n\\nFirst: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any\\n\\ngame is the person who plays fair. This is because playing fair,\\n\\n\\x0cdespite the particularities of any given game, is a higher-order\\naccomplishment than mere victory. Striving to play fair, in the\\nultimate sense—following the spirit of the rules, as well as the letter—\\nis an indication of true personality development, predicated as it is\\non concern for true reciprocity. The Seekers of the Snitch must\\nignore the details of the game of Quidditch, of which they are still a\\npart, while attempting to find and seize the Snitch, just as the player\\nof a real-world game must ignore the particularities of that game\\nwhile attending to what constitutes truly ethical play, regardless of\\nwhat is happening on the playing field. Thus, the ethical player, like\\nthe Seeker, indomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst\\nof complex, competing obligations.\\n\\nSecond: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated\\nwith the winged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the\\nrealm of the divine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of\\ngood fortune. It is for this reason that the ancient symbol for\\nMercury is located at the very pinnacle (the most important location)\\nof the image in question. It is an attempt to indicate what guides the\\nprocess that the picture represents. Centuries ago, prior to the dawn\\nof modern chemistry, the god Mercury represented what inspires or\\nattracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit who possessed a\\nperson when his or her attention was drawn irresistibly to some\\nperson, situation, or event. Imagine that there are very complex\\nprocesses going on in your mind unconsciously, highlighting events\\nof potential worth and distinguishing them from everything else\\nconstantly unfolding around you. Imagine that those processes that\\ndistinguish value are alive, which is certainly the case, and that they\\nare complex and integrated enough to be conceptualized as a\\npersonality. That is Mercury. The draw he exerts on our attention\\nreveals itself in a sense of significance—in the sense that something\\nhappening around you is worth attending to, or contains something\\nof value. The Seeker—in real life, as well as in Rowling’s Potter series\\nand its Quidditch game—is he or she who takes that sense of\\nsignificance more seriously than anything else. The Seeker is\\ntherefore the person who is playing the game that everyone else is\\nplaying (and who is disciplined and expert at the game), but who is\\nalso playing an additional, higher-order game: the pursuit of what is\\nof primary significance. The Snitch (like the round chaos) can\\ntherefore be considered the “container” of that primary significance\\n\\n\\x0c—that meaning—and, therefore, something revelatory when pursued\\nand caught. We might in this context remember what has come to be\\nknown as the Golden Rule: “And as ye would that men should do to\\nyou, do ye also to them likewise” (Luke 6:31). There is nothing more\\nimportant than learning to strive under difficult and frustrating\\ncircumstances to play fair. This is what should be chased, so to\\nspeak, during any game (even though it is also important to try to\\nobtain victory in the game).*\\n\\nEach of us, when fortunate, is compelled forward by something\\n\\nthat grips our attention—love of a person; a sport; a political,\\nsociological, or economic problem, or a scientific question; a passion\\nfor art, literature, or drama—something that calls to us for reasons\\nwe can neither control nor understand (try to make yourself\\ninterested in something you just do not care about and see how well\\nthat works). The phenomena that grip us (phenomena: from the\\nGreek word phainesthai, “to appear, or to be brought to light”) are\\nlike lamps along a dark path: they are part of the unconscious\\nprocesses devoted to integrating and furthering the development of\\nour spirits, the furtherance of our psychological development. You do\\nnot choose what interests you. It chooses you. Something manifests\\nitself out of the darkness as compelling, as worth living for; following\\nthat, something moves us further down the road, to the next\\nmeaningful manifestation—and so it goes, as we continue to seek,\\ndevelop, grow, and thrive. It is a perilous journey, but it is also the\\nadventure of our lives. Think of pursuing someone you love: catch\\nthem or not, you change in the process. Think, as well, of the\\ntraveling you have done, or of the work you have undertaken,\\nwhether for pleasure or necessity. In all these cases you experience\\nwhat is new. Sometimes that is painful; sometimes it is better than\\nanything else that has ever happened to you. Either way, it is deeply\\ninformative. It is all part of the potential of the world, calling you\\ninto Being, changing you forever—for better or worse—in\\nconsequence of your pursuit.\\n\\nAtop the round chaos perches a dragon. This is because what is\\ninteresting and meaningful (and novel and unexpected, as those all\\ngo together) manifests itself in a form that is both dangerous and\\npromising, particularly when its grip is intense and irresistible. The\\ndanger is, of course, signified by the presence of the immortal,\\npredatory reptile; the promise is hinted at, as a dragon archetypally\\n\\n\\x0cguards a great treasure. Thus, the drawing represents a psychological\\nprogression. First, you find yourself interested in something. That\\nsomething (the round chaos) contains or is composed of potential, or\\ninformation. If it is pursued and caught, it releases that information.\\nOut of that information we build the world we perceive, and we build\\nourselves as perceivers. Thus, the round chaos is the container from\\nwhich both matter (the world) and spirit (our psyches) emerge.\\nThere is some numerological indication of this on the spherical body\\nof the round chaos itself: the number 3, accompanied by a triangle,\\nwhich is traditionally associated with spirit (because of its\\nassociation with the Holy Trinity), and the number 4, associated with\\nthe world of matter (because of its association with the four\\ntraditional elements: earth, water, wind, and fire). The dragon, in\\nturn, perched on top of the round chaos, represents the danger and\\npossibility of the information within.\\n\\nAtop the dragon stands a figure known as a Rebis, a single body\\nwith two heads, one male, one female. The Rebis is a symbol of the\\nfully developed personality that can emerge from forthright and\\ncourageous pursuit of what is meaningful (the round chaos) and\\ndangerous and promising (the dragon). It has a symbolically\\nmasculine aspect, which typically stands for exploration, order, and\\nrationality (indicated by the Sun, which can be seen to the left of the\\nmale head), and a symbolically feminine aspect, which stands for\\nchaos, promise, care, renewal, and emotion (indicated by the Moon,\\nto the right of the female). In the course of normal socialization, it is\\ntypical for one of these aspects to become more developed than the\\nother (as males are socialized in the male manner, to which they are\\nalso inclined biologically, and females in the female manner).\\nNonetheless, it is possible—with enough exploration, enough\\nexposure to the round chaos and the dragon—to develop both\\nelements. That constitutes an ideal—or so goes the alchemical\\nintuition.\\n\\nOut of the unknown—the potential that makes up the world—\\n\\ncomes the terrible but promising form of the dragon, peril and\\npromise united. It is an eternal dichotomy echoed by the presence of\\nthe two remaining symbols to the right and above the dragon’s tail:\\nJupiter, representing the positive, and Saturn, the negative. Out of\\nthe confrontation with peril and promise emerges the masculine and\\nfeminine aspects of the psyche, working together in harmony.\\n\\n\\x0cGuiding the process is the spirit Mercurius, manifesting itself as\\nmeaning in the world, working through unconscious means to attract\\nexploration to what will unite the various discordant and warring\\nelements of the personality. This can all be read, appropriately, as a\\nstory of the development of the ideal personality—an attempt, in\\nimage, to describe what each of us could be.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nNow we are going to attempt a description of “who you could be”\\nfrom another perspective, taken from one of the earliest stories we\\nhave been fortunate enough to rediscover. In the ancient\\nMesopotamian Enuma Elish (translation: When on High) we have\\nthe oldest near-complete hero myth known, estimated at four\\nthousand years of age in its written form and, no doubt, far older as\\nan oral tradition. The story begins when the primordial goddess\\nTiamat, embodiment of salt water (as well as a monstrous aquatic\\ndragon), enters into sexual union with her equally primordial male\\nconsort, Apsu, the embodiment of fresh water. This union gives rise\\nto the initial realm of being, inhabited by the elder gods, the first\\nchildren of Tiamat and Apsu.\\n\\nTo understand the beginning of this story, we need to know a few\\n\\nthings the ancients held to be fundamentally true. These are\\nmarkedly different from the truths of modern science. Before the\\ndawn of the scientific worldview, a mere six hundred years ago,\\nreality was construed as all that which human beings experience.\\nThat which we experience can be distinguished, conceptually, from\\nreality as objective world—pure physical being—by its more\\ncomprehensive contents, which include subjective experiences such\\nas emotions, dreams, visions, and motivational states such as\\nhunger, thirst, and pain. That which we experience is better\\ncompared to a novel or a movie, which concentrates on the\\ncommunication and sharing of subjective as well as objective states,\\nthan is reality as objective world, which we might liken to a scientific\\ndescription of physical reality. It is the actual, particular, and unique\\n\\n\\x0cdemise of someone you love, for example, compared to the listing of\\nthat death in the hospital records. It is the drama of lived experience.\\nIt is because our own experience is genuinely literary, narrative,\\nembodied, and storylike that we are so attracted to fictional\\nrepresentations. Movies, plays, operas, TV dramas—even the lyrics of\\nsongs—help us deal with our lived experiences, which are something\\ndifferent and broader than the mere material from which our\\nexperience hypothetically rises.\\n\\nEngaging with the first part of the Enuma Elish requires us to\\nunderstand a second fundamental realization of the ancients: the\\nfundamentally social nature of our cognitive categories. That is why\\neverything is personified in children’s books: the Sun, the Moon,\\ntoys, animals—even machines. We see nothing strange in this,\\nbecause it so profoundly mirrors our perceptual tendencies. We\\nexpect children to view and understand the world in this manner,\\nand we can easily fall back into doing so ourselves. Something should\\nbe clarified here: It is not truly accurate to state that the reality\\nportrayed in children’s fiction is personified. It is the case, instead\\n(and this is a genuine reversal of the presumption in question), that\\nwe directly and naturally perceive reality as personified, and then\\nmust work very diligently to strip that personification away, so that\\nwe can detect “objective reality.”* We understand reality, therefore,\\nas if it is constructed of personalities. That is because so much of\\nwhat we encounter in our hypersocial reality, our complex societies,\\nis in fact personality—and gendered personality, at that, reflecting\\nthe billion years or so since the emergence of sexual reproduction\\n(ample time for its existence to have profoundly structured our\\nperceptions). We understand male, and abstract from that the\\nmasculine. We understand female, and abstract from that the\\nfeminine. Finally, we understand the child, and abstract from that,\\nmost commonly, the son. These basic divisions are clearly reflected\\nin the creation story of the Enuma Elish, just as they are reflected in,\\nor more accurately underpin, our understanding of the stories we all\\nknow.\\n\\nTiamat, the primordial goddess, is chaos, a female monster, a\\ndragon. She is the terror of nature, creative and destructive, mother\\nand slayer of us all. Apsu, her husband, is the eternal father. He is\\nthe order that we depend upon for security, and by which we are\\nsimultaneously tyrannized.* These two most primal of deities come\\n\\n\\x0ctogether in a productive, sexual union, “mingling their waters,” in the\\nancient words. In this fashion, they produce their first progeny, the\\nelder gods of Mesopotamia. These gods represent elements of the\\nworld more differentiated than the primordial mother and father—\\nsuch as heaven and earth, mud and silt, and war and fire.* However,\\nthey are also careless, noisy, and impulsive as two-year-old children\\n(who are, after all, primal forces in their own right). Their continual\\nceaseless, thoughtless activity and general unconsciousness\\nculminates in a catastrophe: their mutual decision to wage war upon\\nand then slay Apsu, and consequent attempt to build a stable\\ndwelling place on his corpse.\\n\\nTiamat—chaos itself—already irritated by the brainless racket of\\nher children, is murderously enraged by the heedless slaughter of her\\nhusband. The Terrible Goddess builds an army of eleven monsters to\\ndeal with her wayward offspring, placing a demonic figure named\\nKingu, whom she takes as a second husband, at their head, and\\ndelivering to him the Tablet of Destinies (indicating his authority as\\nultimate ruler of the universe). The relationship between this\\nbrilliant dramatic representation and how we use, or misuse, the\\ngifts of our culture is obvious: the careless demolition of tradition is\\nthe invitation to the (re)emergence of chaos. When ignorance\\ndestroys culture, monsters will emerge.\\n\\nWhile Tiamat busily arranges her army, the elder gods continue\\n\\ntheir activity, pairing off, producing children, and then\\ngrandchildren, of their own. One of the latter, Marduk, appears\\nparticularly talented, powerful, and promising. He is born with eyes\\nencircling his head. He can see everywhere. He can speak magic\\nwords. He is something entirely new—and this is noted early by his\\nprogenitors. While Marduk matures, the elder gods are compelled to\\nconfront Tiamat, with whom they are now at war. One after another\\nthey attempt to defeat her. All return in abject failure. Finally,\\nsomeone suggests that Marduk, though still young, should be sent to\\nconfront his terrible grandmother. Approached with this idea, he\\nagrees, but only on the condition that he is awarded the right,\\nhenceforth—if he is victorious—to hold the Tablet of Destinies, and\\nsit atop the dominance hierarchy of the gods.\\n\\nIt is in this manner that this ancient story describes the emergence\\n\\nof monotheism out of polytheism. The Enuma Elish appears to be a\\ndramatized account of the psychological or spiritual processes\\n\\n\\x0ccomprising this transformation. The ancient Mesopotamian\\ncivilization faced the necessity of incorporating and unifying many\\ndiverse tribes and peoples, each of whom had their own gods. The\\ngod who arose out of the conflict between all those gods (“Whose god\\nis supreme?”) was, therefore, a meta-god—a god composed of what\\nwas most important about all gods. It was for such a reason, for\\nexample, that fifty different names characterized Marduk. This\\nemergence of one from many is a very common process, described by\\nthe scholar of myth Mircea Eliade as the war of the gods in heaven, a\\ntypical mythological motif, as well as alluded to earlier.* It is the\\npsychological counterpart, in the world of imagination, to the\\ngenuine struggle of concepts of divinity and value on earth. Tribes\\nunite. Each has its gods. The people comprising these multitudinous\\ngroups go to war, concretely and conceptually, for what they believe\\n—sometimes for generations. It is as if the gods they follow were\\nbattling for dominance over periods exceeding single human lives,\\nusing their followers as proxies. That is reflected in the ancient\\nstories. If and when the gods come to an agreement about their\\nrelative positions—more particularly, if they arrange themselves into\\na hierarchy—it means that peace has genuinely been established,\\nbecause peace is the establishment of a shared hierarchy of divinity,\\nof value. Thus, an eternal question emerges whenever people of\\ndifferent backgrounds are required to deal with one another on a\\nrelatively permanent basis: What do all gods share that makes them\\ngods? What is God, in essence?\\n\\nThat is a very difficult question. It is, on the one hand, the\\n\\nquestion of value: What is of the highest importance? It is, on the\\nother hand, the question of sovereignty: What principle should rule?\\nThese are the questions posed by those pondering the ultimate\\nsource of divine significance itself. Their difficulty meant that they,\\nand by extension the question of God, had to be answered over\\ncenturies, over millennia. The answer emerged first in story form.\\nThe Mesopotamians brilliantly intuited that the highest god—the\\nhighest good—involved careful attention (the multiple, head-circling\\neyes of Marduk) and effective language (the magic words of Marduk,\\ncapable of generating a cosmos), in addition to the courage and\\nstrength to voluntarily confront and overcome chaos, the unknown.\\nIt could be argued that these are the defining features of the great\\n\\n\\x0ccentral spirit of mankind, at least insofar as that spirit is noble and\\nadmirable.\\n\\nThe ancient Egyptians formulated an idea similar in many\\n\\nimportant regards—which we will discuss later in detail—associating\\ntheir savior-god Horus, son of Osiris, with the sharp-eyed falcon, and\\nidentifying him with the vision willing to search out, detect,\\nunderstand, and defeat evil (symbolized with the famous Egyptian\\nimage of the single eye). Representing that reality—pay attention,\\nabove all, even to what is monstrous and malevolent, and speak\\nwisely and truthfully—could be the single most important\\naccomplishment of our species.4 It allows us to apprehend in\\ndramatic form the fundamental necessity of coming to grips with\\nwhat our senses demonstrate to us, no matter how terrifying the\\nreality revealed. It allows for the possibility of bringing our explicit\\nunderstanding closer in line with our deepest being, making possible\\na truer union of body and spirit through the partial comprehension\\nand imitation of the story. Most importantly, perhaps, it allows us to\\nrealize the immense importance of words in transforming potential\\ninto actuality, and helps us understand that the role we each play in\\nthat transformation is in some vital sense akin to the divine.\\n\\nAfter his election to the highest of places, Marduk challenges\\nTiamat directly, encloses her, defeated, in a giant net, and cuts her\\ninto pieces, fashioning the heavens and the earth from her remains.\\nOne of Marduk’s many names is, in fact, “he who makes ingenious\\nthings as a consequence of the conflict with Tiamat.”5 It might be\\nnoted, in this regard, that tens of thousands of years ago, men\\nliterally did construct the habitable world out of the pieces of\\nmonsters, making their early dwellings from the giant bones of\\nanimals they had so courageously speared.6 Marduk simultaneously\\ndefeats his grandmother’s monstrous army, including the leader,\\nKingu, from whom he takes the Tablet of Destinies, confirming his\\nplace as supreme leader of the cosmos. Then he returns home,\\nenemies in tow. His compatriots celebrate his victory and accede yet\\nmore completely to his leadership, before he assigns them their\\nvarious duties. Then, after consulting Ea, the god of wisdom, Marduk\\ndetermines to create man, to aid the gods most fundamentally in the\\neternal task of maintaining the proper balance between order and\\nchaos—to release those very gods from their service, and to transfer\\ntheir burden onto our all-too-human shoulders.*\\n\\n\\x0cThe basic story is this: when order (Apsu) is carelessly threatened\\n\\nor destroyed, the terrible forces of chaos from which the world was\\noriginally derived appear once again in their most destructive,\\nmonstrous, predatory guise. Then a hero, representing the highest of\\nvalues, must arise or be elected to confront this chaotic force. He\\ndoes so successfully, deriving or producing something of great worth.\\nWhat the hero represents is the most important of the great forces\\nthat make up the human psyche. To think of it another way: the hero\\nis the embodied principle of action and perception that must rule\\nover all the primordial psychological elements of lust, rage, hunger,\\nthirst, terror, and joy. For chaos to remain effectively at bay (or, even\\nbetter, tamed and therefore harnessed), this heroic principle must be\\nregarded as the most important of all things that can organize and\\nmotivate mankind. This means, at least, that it must be continually\\nacted out, which is what “regarded as important” actually means. It is\\nin this way that the spirit of Marduk still possesses each individual\\nwho engages courageously in the processes of encounter and\\nconfrontation that eternally create and renew society. It is this that\\nhappens when each small child learns to regulate and unite his\\nemotions and motivations into a coherent personality, and then goes\\nout to challenge the unknown world.\\n\\nIn slightly altered form, this is the story of St. George: The\\n\\ninhabitants of an ancient city must obtain water from a well beside\\nthe nest of a dragon. To do so, however, they have to offer the dragon\\nsome sacrifice—a sheep, under most circumstances, but a maiden, if\\nno sheep can be found. The young women of the city draw lots when\\nthe supply of sheep is exhausted. One day it is the daughter of the\\nking herself who loses. St. George appears, confronts the dragon with\\nthe sign of the cross—symbol of the eternal Redeemer, the archetypal\\nhero—and frees the doomed princess. The city’s inhabitants then\\nconvert to Christianity. Victory over the dragon—the predator, as\\nsuch, the ruler of unexplored territory—is victory over all the forces\\nthat have threatened the individual and society, over evolutionary\\nand historical spans of time, as well as the more abstract evil we all\\nstill face, without and within. The cross, for its part, is the burden of\\nlife. It is a place of betrayal, torture, and death. It is therefore a\\nfundamental symbol of mortal vulnerability. In the Christian drama,\\nit is also the place where vulnerability is transcended, as a\\nconsequence of its acceptance. This voluntary acceptance is also\\n\\n\\x0cequivalent to victory over the dragon, representation of chaos, death,\\nand the unknown. By accepting life’s suffering, therefore, evil may be\\novercome. The alternative is hell, at least in its psychological form:\\nrage, resentment, and the desire for revenge and destruction.\\n\\nThe same story is echoed in the tales of St. Patrick, who chases the\\n\\nsnakes out of Ireland, and St. Michael, who defeats the Christian\\nequivalent of Kingu, “that ancient serpent called the devil”\\n(Revelation 12:9). This is the same story recounted by J. R. R.\\nTolkien in The Hobbit, which was in turn derived from the ancient\\npoem Beowulf, the tale of a hero defeating a pair of intelligent\\nmonsters—son, and then worse, mother.7 In The Hobbit, the hero\\ndevelops character and wisdom (as a thief, strangely enough) during\\nhis quest to help discover the ancient treasure hoarded by the\\ndragon. The story of Perseus and Medusa, whose visage was so\\nterrible that it turned onlookers to stone, is another variant, as is\\nPinocchio, who rescues his father from a subaquatic monster, and\\ndies and is reborn while doing so. Something similar is portrayed in\\nthe first of the recent Avengers movies, in which Iron Man—the man\\nwho has transformed himself into a partly golden superhero—defeats\\nthe alien dragon worms of the Chitauri (allied with the satanic Loki).\\nHe then dies, is reborn, and gets the maiden (in the nonswooning\\nguise of Ms. Pepper Potts). It must be understood: Such stories\\nwould not even be comprehensible (not least to children, as well as\\nadults) if our evolutionary history had importantly differed, and if\\nour entire culture had not been shaped, implicitly and explicitly, by\\nthese ancient patterns.\\n\\nAll these heroes act out what was perhaps the greatest discovery\\never made by man’s primordial ancestors: if you have the vision and\\nthe courage (and a good stout stick, when necessary), you can chase\\naway the worst of snakes. No doubt the greatest of our ancestors\\nwere beginning to threaten snakes with sticks when we still lived in\\ntrees. No doubt it was those voluntarily snake-chasing ancestors who\\nreaped the benefits of their bravery in the form of nearby grateful\\nmaidens (or their ancestral arboreal equivalents)—and perhaps this\\nis why dragons hoard virgins, as well as gold. What constitutes the\\nworst of all snakes and the stoutest of all sticks, however, might be\\nregarded as the central religious questions of humanity. It is\\ninteresting to note that in The Hobbit, the worst snake is “only” a\\ndragon, but in The Lord of the Rings, the worst snake, so to speak, is\\n\\n\\x0cthe much more abstract evil of the wizard Sauron. As humanity\\nbecame more sophisticated in its capacity to abstract, we\\nincreasingly appreciated the fact that predatory monsters can come\\nin many guises, only some of which are animal in their form.\\nLiterature of an arguably more sophisticated form endlessly echoes\\nthis realization.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIn the second volume of J. K. Rowling’s fantasy series, Harry Potter\\nand the Chamber of Secrets, the castle of Hogwarts is threatened by\\nstrange, chaotic forces, due to the earlier and ongoing misbehavior of\\nseveral powerful adult wizards (as established in volume one). Now,\\nit is significant that Harry is orphaned: it is an integral part of the\\nheroic pattern. He has his earthly parents, the thick and conventional\\nDursleys, willfully blind, shortsighted, and terribly overprotective of\\n(and, therefore, tragically dangerous to) Dudley, their unfortunate\\nbut predictably self-centered and bullying natural son. But Harry has\\nhis heavenly parents, too, his true mother and father—symbolically,\\nNature and Culture (variants of chaos and order). They exist as part\\nof his intrinsically magical potential—the magical potential of all of\\nus, in fact, as we are all children of Nature and Culture, with the\\ntremendous potential that implies, as well as the more mundane\\noffspring of our particular parents.8\\n\\nWhen Harry returns to Hogwarts after his summer vacation, he\\ncan detect strange and ominous noises emanating from somewhere\\nin the building. At the same time, various students and residents of\\nHogwarts are found paralyzed—turned to stone—in diverse locations\\naround the building. Turned to stone: What could that possibly\\nmean? It certainly means to be unable to move—but it also signifies\\nsomething deeper. It means to be hunted; to become a rabbit\\nconfronted by a wolf; to become the horrified and awestruck object\\nof the predatory gaze. Many herbivores, comparatively defenseless,\\nfacing imminent and brutal death, freeze in place, paralyzed by fear,\\ndepending on camouflage and immobility to render them invisible to\\nthe terrible intentions of nearby red-toothed and razor-clawed\\n\\n\\x0ccarnivores. Predatory, reptilian forms still particularly have that\\neffect on human beings (hence our awed fascination, for example,\\nwith dinosaurs). But to have no more courage than a rabbit is\\ndefinitely not to be everything you could be.\\n\\nEventually Harry learns that the force turning his friends into\\nstone is a gigantic snake, a basilisk, whose gaze exerts a paralyzing\\nforce. He discovers that this serpent is continually slithering around\\nthe very foundation of Hogwarts, in the immense waterworks that\\nserve the great castle. This basilisk is an analog to the great dragon\\nfaced by Beowulf, hero of the thousand-year-old story that served as\\npattern for Tolkien’s adventures, perhaps the twentieth century’s\\nclosest cousins to J. K. Rowling’s extensive fantasy. It is, as well, the\\ngreat devouring shark of the movie Jaws, lurking in the black water\\nof night, ready at a moment’s notice to pull the naked and unwary\\nbelow; the fragility of our homes and our institutions, which can\\ncollapse and leave us stripped of their protective walls in a single\\nterrible moment; and more comprehensively, the underworld of the\\nancients, whose doors gape open when everything predictable\\ncollapses. At the deepest of levels, this is the chaos and potential that\\ncontinually lurks under the order of our familiar worlds,\\npsychological and social.\\n\\nAfter much searching, Harry gains entrance to this underworld\\nlabyrinth of pipes and tunnels, and finds the central chamber. He\\ndoes this, significantly, through the sewer, acting out the ancient\\nalchemical dictum, in sterquilinis invenitur: in filth it will be found.*\\nWhat does this mean? That which you most need to find will be\\nfound where you least wish to look.* There, underground, Ginny\\n(Virgin-ia), his best friend’s sister and Harry’s eventual serious\\nromantic interest, lies unconscious. She is the maiden—or the\\nanima, the soul—forever incarcerated by the dragon, as in the tale of\\nSt. George. It is up to Harry, orphaned hero, to wake and rescue her\\n(just as Tolkien’s Bilbo helps take the gold from the terrible Smaug;\\njust as Disney’s Prince Phillip rescues Sleeping Beauty—both\\nrescuing what is most valuable from the clutches of a great dragon).*\\nAnd of course, the unknown is a great predator—the basilisk Harry\\n\\nfaces—and of course, that predator guards a great treasure, gold\\nbeyond measure or the sleeping virgin, because the individual brave\\nenough to voluntarily beard the serpent in his lair is most likely to\\ngain access to the untold riches that exist in potential, awaiting us in\\n\\n\\x0cthe adventure of our life, away from security and what is currently\\nknown. Who dares wins*—if he does not perish. And who wins also\\nmakes himself irresistibly desirable and attractive, not least because\\nof the development of character that adventure inevitably produces.\\nAnd this is what makes us forever more than rabbits.\\n\\nAnd Harry, like Bilbo, can only manage this—can only perceive the\\n\\nserpent, when it is invisible to everyone else—because he has a dark\\nside. Tolkien’s Bilbo must become a thief before he can become a\\nhero. He must incorporate his monstrousness, so that he can\\nsupersede his naive harmlessness, before he is tough enough to face\\nthe terrors that confront him. Harry is touched by evil in another\\nmanner, as part of the incomparably dark wizard Voldemort’s soul is\\nembedded within him (although neither he nor Voldemort are\\ninitially aware of this). It is for this reason that the young wizard can\\nspeak with and hear (that is, perceive) snakes. It is in keeping with\\nthis that he is disciplined and courageous, but also willing and ready\\nto break the rules when necessary.\\n\\nWhile in the bowels of Hogwarts, Harry comes under attack by the\\n\\nbasilisk, which is under the control of Voldemort. Voldemort\\ntherefore bears the same relationship to the basilisk in Hogwarts as\\nSatan does, strangely and incomprehensibly, to the vision-granting\\nserpent in the Genesis story of the Garden of Eden. Why might this\\nbe? It could be said—and should be—that one form of serpentine\\nchaos and danger is the threat of the reptilian predator itself. But\\nanother form, more abstract—more psychological, more spiritual—is\\nhuman evil: the danger we pose to one another. At some point in our\\nevolutionary and cultural history, we began to understand that\\nhuman evil could rightly be considered the greatest of all snakes. So,\\nthe symbolic progression might be (1) snake as evil predator, then (2)\\nexternal human enemy as snake/evil/predator, then (3) subjective,\\npersonal, or psychological darkness/vengefulness/deceit as\\nsnake/evil/predator. Each of these representations, which took\\nuntold centuries, perhaps millennia to conceptualize, constitute a\\ntangible increase in the sophistication of the image of evil.9\\n\\nAll such manifestations of serpentine chaos and danger are\\n\\napparently still first detected, processed, and symbolically\\ninterassociated by the ancient brain systems that evolved to protect\\nus from predatory reptiles.10 And freezing—prompted by those\\nsystems—solves the problem now, maybe, by hiding the individual\\n\\n\\x0cwho is currently being preyed upon, but it leaves the predator alive\\nfor tomorrow. Instead, the danger must be hunted down and\\ndestroyed—and even that is too concrete to constitute a permanent\\nsolution to the problem of evil itself (rather than a solution to any\\nparticular exemplar of evil). Most profoundly and abstractly\\n(paralleling the idea that the greatest predator, the greatest snake, is\\nthe evil that lurks within), evil’s destruction manifests as the life of\\nvirtue that constrains malevolence in its most abstracted and\\ncomprehensive form. It is for this reason, for example, that the\\nDisney prince Phillip of Sleeping Beauty fame is armed for his\\nconflict with the great Dragon of Chaos by benevolent Nature (in the\\nform of the feminine fairies that accompany him and aid in his\\nescape from Maleficent, the Evil Queen) with the Sword of Truth and\\nShield of Virtue.\\n\\nHarry directly confronts the basilisk, down in the Chamber of\\n\\nSecrets, deep below the wizarding castle, but is cornered and in great\\nperil. At that propitious moment, a phoenix kept by the wise\\nheadmaster of Hogwarts arrives, provides the young hero with a\\nsword, and then attacks the giant snake, providing Harry with time\\nto regroup. Harry slays the basilisk with the weapon, but is fatally\\nbitten in the process. This is another deep mythological echo: In the\\nstory of Genesis, for example, the encounter with the snake proves\\nfatal to man and woman alike, who become aware of their fragility\\nand inevitable death soon after they awaken and gain vision. It is also\\na harsh truth: predators devour, dragons lay waste, chaos destroys.\\nThe threat is real. Even truth, virtue, and courage are not necessarily\\nenough, but they are our best bet. And sometimes a little death is the\\nmedication necessary to forestall death itself. Fortunately, the\\nphoenix has magical, revivifying tears, which it cries into Harry’s\\nwounds. Thus, the young wizard revives, defeats Voldemort (a much\\nmore challenging task than merely overcoming the gargantuan\\nserpent), rescues Ginny, and saves the school.\\n\\nIt is with the introduction of the phoenix to the story of St. George\\n\\nthat Rowling reveals another element of her intuitive genius. The\\nphoenix is a fowl that can die and be reborn forever. It has, therefore,\\nthroughout the ages, been a symbol of Christ, with whom the magical\\nbird shares many features. It is also, equally, that element of the\\nindividual human personality that must die and regenerate, as it\\nlearns, painfully, through the oft-tragic experience that destroys\\n\\n\\x0cprevious certainty, replacing it first with doubt, and then—when\\nsuccessfully confronted—with new and more complete knowledge. A\\nvoluntary death-and-rebirth transformation—the change necessary\\nto adapt when terrible things emerge—is therefore a solution to the\\npotentially fatal rigidity of erroneous certainty, excessive order, and\\nstultification.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nPeople exchange information about how to act in many ways. They\\nobserve each other and imitate what they see. When they imitate,\\nthey use their bodies to represent the bodies of others. But this\\nimitation is not mindless, automatized mimicry. It is instead the\\nability to identify regularities or patterns in the behavior of other\\npeople, and then to imitate those patterns. When a young girl plays\\nat being a mother, for example, she does not duplicate, gesture for\\ngesture, what she has previously observed of her mother’s actions.\\nInstead she acts “as if” she were a mother. If you ask the girl what\\nshe is doing, she will tell you that she is pretending to be a mother,\\nbut if you get her to describe what that means, particularly if she is a\\nyoung child, her description will be far less complete than her actions\\nwould indicate. This means she can act out more than she can say—\\njust as we all can. If you observed many little girls, acting out many\\nmothers, you could derive a very good idea of what “mother” meant,\\nin its purest form, even if you had never seen an actual mother. If\\nyou were good with words, then perhaps you could describe the\\nessential elements of maternal behavior and transmit them. You\\nmight do that best in the form of a story.\\n\\nIt is easier and more direct to represent a behavioral pattern with\\n\\nbehavior than with words. Outright mimicry does that directly,\\naction for action. Imitation, which can produce new behaviors akin\\nto those that motivated the mimicry, takes that one step further.\\nDrama—formalized imitation, enacted upon a stage—is precisely\\nbehavior portraying behavior, but distilled ever closer to the essence.\\nLiterature takes that transmission one more difficult step, portraying\\naction in the imagination of the writer and the reader, in the\\ncomplete absence of both real actors and a material stage. It is only\\nthe greatest of storytellers who can manage that transformation,\\n\\n\\x0crepresenting the greatest and most vitally necessary of acts in the\\nmost interesting, profound, and memorable words. Generations of\\ngreat storytellers, retelling, modifying, and editing great stories,\\ntherefore end up jointly creating the greatest of stories. Once cultures\\nbecome literate (something that has happened only recently, from\\nthe historical perspective), those stories can be written down. It is at\\nthis point, roughly, that myth and ritual might be said to transform\\nthemselves into religion.\\n\\nThe imitation and communication of the greatest, most\\n\\nmemorable acts necessitates distillation and communication of the\\npatterns of the deepest wisdom of mankind. If a great and\\nmemorable act is one undertaken by a particularly admirable\\nindividual, a local hero, then the greatest and most memorable acts\\npossible would be those undertaken by the spirit (embodied in part\\nby particular individuals) who exemplified what all local heroes\\neverywhere have in common. That hero of heroes—that meta-hero—\\nwould have to exist, logically, in turn, in a place that was common\\nacross all places requiring heroism. That place might be regarded as\\na meta-world—even though it is real, even hyperreal (that is, more\\nreal in its abstraction across places than our direct perceptions of a\\ngiven, singular time or place). It is precisely this hyperreal meta-\\nworld that consists of the continual interactions between chaos and\\norder, which eternally serve as the battleground between good and\\nevil characterizing the hero. The undying pattern that hero\\nembodies, in turn—upon whose actions the individual and society\\nboth depend—is the highest of all Gods. He is both child of and\\nmediator between those twin forces, transforming chaos into\\nhabitable order (as well as recasting order into chaos, so that it can\\nbe renewed, when it has become anachronistic and corrupt), as well\\nas battling mightily so that good might prevail.\\n\\nEveryone requires a story to structure their perceptions and\\n\\nactions in what would otherwise be the overwhelming chaos of being.\\nEvery story requires a starting place that is not good enough and an\\nending place that is better. Nothing can be judged in the absence of\\nthat end place, that higher value. Without it, everything sinks into\\nmeaninglessness and boredom or degenerates and spirals into terror,\\nanxiety, and pain. But, as time changes all things inexorably, every\\nspecific, value-predicated story may fail, in its particular incarnation\\nand locale, and need replacement by something newer, more\\n\\n\\x0ccomplete, but different. In consequence, the actor of a given story\\n(and, therefore, someone deeply affiliated with the plot and the\\ncharacterization) still must bow to the spirit of creative\\ntransformation that originally created and may need to destroy and\\nre-create that story. It is for this reason that spirit eternally\\ntranscends dogma, truth transcends presupposition, Marduk\\ntranscends the elder gods, creativity updates society, and Christ\\ntranscends the law (as does Harry Potter, along with his courageous\\nbut continually rule-breaking friends). But it is important to\\nremember, as we discussed in Rule I: Those who break the rules\\nethically are those who have mastered them first and disciplined\\nthemselves to understand the necessity of those rules, and break\\nthem in keeping with the spirit rather than the letter of the law.\\n\\nThe second volume of Rowling’s series proposes that predatory\\nevil can be overcome by the soul willing to die and be reborn. The\\ncomplete series ends with a creatively transformed repetition of the\\nsame message. The analogy with Christianity is obvious, and the\\nmessage, in essence, the same: The soul willing to transform, as\\ndeeply as necessary, is the most effective enemy of the demonic\\nserpents of ideology and totalitarianism, in their personal and social\\nforms. The healthy, dynamic, and above all else truthful personality\\nwill admit to error. It will voluntarily shed—let die—outdated\\nperceptions, thoughts, and habits, as impediments to its further\\nsuccess and growth. This is the soul that will let its old beliefs burn\\naway, often painfully, so that it can live again, and move forward,\\nrenewed. This is also the soul that will transmit what it has learned\\nduring that process of death and rebirth, so that others can be reborn\\nalong with it.\\n\\nAim at something. Pick the best target you can currently\\n\\nconceptualize. Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and\\nmisconceptions along the way, face them, and correct them. Get your\\nstory straight. Past, present, future—they all matter. You need to\\nmap your path. You need to know where you were, so that you do not\\nrepeat the mistakes of the past. You need to know where you are, or\\nyou will not be able to draw a line from your starting point to your\\ndestination. You need to know where you are going, or you will\\ndrown in uncertainty, unpredictability, and chaos, and starve for\\nhope and inspiration. For better or worse, you are on a journey. You\\nare having an adventure—and your map better be accurate.\\n\\n\\x0cVoluntarily confront what stands in your way. The way—that is the\\npath of life, the meaningful path of life, the straight and narrow path\\nthat constitutes the very border between order and chaos, and the\\ntraversing of which brings them into balance.\\n\\nAim at something profound and noble and lofty. If you can find a\\n\\nbetter path along the way, once you have started moving forward,\\nthen switch course. Be careful, though; it is not easy to discriminate\\nbetween changing paths and simply giving up. (One hint: if the new\\npath you see forward, after learning what you needed to learn along\\nyour current way, appears more challenging, then you can be\\nreasonably sure that you are not deluding or betraying yourself when\\nyou change your mind.) In this manner, you will zigzag forward. It is\\nnot the most efficient way to travel, but there is no real alternative,\\ngiven that your goals will inevitably change while you pursue them,\\nas you learn what you need to learn while you are disciplining\\nyourself.\\n\\nYou will then find yourself turning across time, incrementally and\\n\\ngracefully, to aim ever more accurately at that tiny pinpoint, the X\\nthat marks the spot, the bull’s-eye, and the center of the cross; to aim\\nat the highest value of which you can conceive. You will pursue a\\ntarget that is both moving and receding: moving, because you do not\\nhave the wisdom to aim in the proper direction when you first take\\naim; receding, because no matter how close you come to perfecting\\nwhat you are currently practicing, new vistas of possible perfection\\nwill open up in front of you. Discipline and transformation will\\nnonetheless lead you inexorably forward. With will and luck, you will\\nfind a story that is meaningful and productive, improves itself with\\ntime, and perhaps even provides you with more than a few moments\\nof satisfaction and joy. With will and luck, you will be the hero of that\\nstory, the disciplined sojourner, the creative transformer, and the\\nbenefactor of your family and broader society.\\n\\nImagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nDO NOT HIDE UNWANTED THINGS IN THE FOG\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI love my father-in-law. I respect him, too. He is extremely stable\\nemotionally—one of those tough or fortunate people (perhaps a little\\nof both) who can let the trials and tribulations of life roll off him and\\nkeep moving forward with little complaint and plenty of competence.\\nHe is an old guy now, Dell Roberts—eighty-eight. He has had a knee\\nreplaced, and is planning to get the remaining one done. He has had\\nstents inserted into his coronary arteries and a heart valve replaced.\\nHe suffers from drop foot and sometimes slips and falls because of it.\\nBut he was still curling a year ago, pushing the heavy granite rock\\ndown the ice with a stick specifically designed for people who can no\\nlonger crouch down as easily as they once could.\\n\\nWhen his wife, Beth, now deceased, developed dementia at a\\nrelatively young age, he took care of her in as uncomplaining and\\nunresentful a manner as anyone could imagine. It was impressive. I\\nam by no means convinced that I could have fared as well. He cared\\nfor her right to the point where it became impossible for him to lift\\nher out of whatever chair she had settled into. This was long after she\\nhad lost the ability to speak. But it was obvious by the way her eyes\\nlit up when he entered the room that she still loved him—and the\\nfeeling was mutual. I would not describe him as someone who is\\nprone to avoidance when the going gets tough. Quite the contrary.\\n\\nWhen Dell was a much younger man, he was for several decades a\\nreal estate dealer in Fairview, Alberta—the small town where I grew\\nup (we lived right across the street from the Roberts family, in fact).\\nDuring that time, he habitually went home for lunch, in accordance\\nwith the general custom. Beth typically prepared him soup (probably\\n\\n\\x0cCampbell’s, which everyone ate at that time—“M’m! M’m! Good!”),\\nand a sandwich. One day, without warning, he snapped at his wife:\\n“Why in the world do we always eat off these tiny plates? I hate\\neating off these tiny plates!”\\n\\nShe had been serving the sandwiches on bread-and-butter plates,\\nwhich average about six or seven inches in diameter, instead of full-\\nsize dinner plates of ten to twelve inches. She related this story to her\\ndaughters, soon after, in a state of mild shock. This story has been\\nretold to much laughter at family gatherings many times since. After\\nall, she had been serving him lunch on those plates for at least twenty\\nyears by the time he finally said anything. She had no idea that he\\nwas annoyed by her table settings. He had never objected. And there\\nis something inexhaustibly amusing about that.\\n\\nNow, it is possible that he was irritated by something else\\n\\naltogether that day and did not really care about the plates. And in\\none sense, it is a trivial issue. But seen another way, it is not trivial at\\nall, for two reasons. First, if something happens every day, it is\\nimportant, and lunch was happening every day. In consequence, if\\nthere was something about it that was chronically bothersome, even\\nin a minor sort of way, it needed to be attended to. Second, it is very\\ncommon to allow so-called minor irritations (which are not minor, as\\nI said, if they happen constantly) to continue for years without\\ncomment or resolution.\\n\\nHere is the problem: Collect a hundred, or a thousand, of those,\\n\\nand your life is miserable and your marriage doomed. Do not\\npretend you are happy with something if you are not, and if a\\nreasonable solution might, in principle, be negotiated. Have the\\ndamn fight. Unpleasant as that might be in the moment, it is one less\\nstraw on the camel’s back. And that is particularly true for those\\ndaily events that everyone is prone to regard as trivial—even the\\nplates on which you eat your lunch. Life is what repeats, and it is\\nworth getting what repeats right.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nHere is a more serious story of the same type. I had a client who had\\ncome to see me about her plans to move to private practice after\\nmany years as an accountant with a large corporation. She was well\\n\\n\\x0crespected in her profession, and was a competent, kind, and careful\\nperson. But she was also very unhappy. I presumed initially that her\\nunhappiness stemmed from anxiety about her career transition. But\\nshe managed that move without a hitch during the time we\\ncontinued our sessions, while other issues rose to the forefront.\\n\\nHer problem was not her career change. It was her marriage. She\\n\\ndescribed her husband as extraordinarily self-centered and\\nsimultaneously overly concerned with how he appeared in the eyes of\\nothers. It was a contradictory combination, in some manner,\\nalthough it is common enough to see this touching of opposites in a\\npersonality: If you lean too far in one direction, something else in\\nyou leans equally far in the other. So, despite the husband’s\\nnarcissism (at least from his wife’s perspective), he was in thrall to\\nthe opinions of everyone he met—excepting the members of his own\\nfamily. He also drank too much—a habit which exaggerated his\\ntemperamental defects.\\n\\nMy client was not comfortable in her own home. She did not feel\\nthere was anything truly of her within the apartment she shared with\\nher husband (the couple had no children). Her situation provided a\\ngood example of how what is outside can profoundly reflect what is\\ninside (which is why I suggest to people who are in psychological\\ntrouble that they might begin their recovery by cleaning up—and\\nthen beautifying, if possible—their rooms). All their household\\nfurnishings, which she described as showy, ornate, and\\nuncomfortable, had been chosen by her husband. Furthermore, he\\navidly collected 1960s and 70s pop art, and the walls of the house\\nwere crowded with these items, which he had spent time seeking out\\nin galleries and otherwise gathering for many years, often while she\\nsat waiting outside in the car.\\n\\nShe told me that she did not care about the furnishings and the\\nexcess of decorative objects, but that was not really true. What was\\ntrue was that she did not care for them—not a bit. Neither the\\nshowiness nor the furnishings nor the plethora of art works that\\nmade up her husband’s collection appealed to her taste. She tended\\ntoward a minimalist aesthetic (or perhaps that preference was a\\nconsequence of her husband’s decorative excesses). It was never\\nquite clear what she might have preferred, and perhaps that was part\\nof the problem: because she did not know what she liked (and was\\nequally vague about her dislikes), she was not in the strongest\\n\\n\\x0cposition to put forward her own opinions. It is difficult to win an\\nargument, or even begin one, if you have not carefully articulated\\nwhat you want (or do not) and need (or do not).\\n\\nHowever, she certainly did not enjoy feeling like a stranger in her\\nown home. For that reason, she never had friends over to visit, which\\nwas also a nontrivial problem, contributing as it did to her feelings of\\nisolation. But the furnishings and paintings continued to accrue, one\\nshopping expedition at a time, in Canada and abroad, and with each\\npurchase there was less of her in the house and in the marriage, and\\nincreasingly more of her husband. Nonetheless, my client never went\\nto war. She never had a fit of anger. She never put her fist through a\\nparticularly objectionable canvas hanging on the living room wall. In\\nall the decades of her married life, she never had an outburst of\\ngenuine rage; she never directly and conclusively confronted the fact\\nthat she hated her home and her subordination to her husband’s\\ntaste. Instead, she let him have his way, repeatedly, increment by\\nincrement, because she claimed that such trivialities were not worth\\nfighting for. And with each defeat, the next disagreement became\\nmore necessary—although less likely, because she understood that a\\nserious discussion, once initiated, risked expanding to include all the\\nthings that were troublesome about her marriage, and that a real, no-\\nholds-barred battle would therefore likely ensue. Then everything\\nwrong might spill out and have to be faced and dealt with, by one\\nmeans or another. So, she kept silent. But she was chronically\\nrepressed and constantly resentful, and felt that she had wasted\\nmuch of the opportunity of her life.\\n\\nIt is a mistake to consider the furnishings and the pop art\\npaintings as simple material objects. They were more truly and\\nimportantly containers of information, so to speak, about the state of\\nthe marriage, and were certainly experienced as such by my client.\\nEvery single object of art was the concrete realization of a victory\\n(Pyrrhic though it may have been) and a defeat (or, at least, a\\nnegotiation that did not occur and, therefore, a fight that was over\\nbefore it started). And there were dozens or perhaps hundreds of\\nthese: each a weapon in an unspoken, destructive, and decades-long\\nwar. Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances, the couple split up—\\nafter thirty years of marriage. I believe the husband retained all the\\nfurniture and art.\\n\\n\\x0cHere is a thought, a terrifying and dispiriting thought, to motivate\\n\\nimprovement in your marriage—to scare you into the appalling\\ndifficulties of true negotiation. Every little problem you have every\\nmorning, afternoon, or evening with your spouse will be repeated for\\neach of the fifteen thousand days that will make up a forty-year\\nmarriage. Every trivial but chronic disagreement about cooking,\\ndishes, housecleaning, responsibility for finances, or frequency of\\nintimate contact will be duplicated, over and over, unless you\\nsuccessfully address it. Perhaps you think (moment to moment, at\\nleast) that it is best to avoid confrontation and drift along in\\napparent but false peace. Make no mistake about it, however: you\\nage as you drift, just as rapidly as you age as you strive. But you have\\nno direction when you drift, and the probability that you will obtain\\nwhat you need and want by drifting aimlessly is very low. Things fall\\napart of their own accord, but the sins of men speed their\\ndeterioration: that is wisdom from the ages. It may well be that\\nconscious apprehension of the horror of the same small hell forever\\nrepeated is precisely what is necessary to force you to confront the\\nproblems in your marriage and negotiate in good and desperate faith\\nto solve them. However, it is the easiest of matters, particularly in the\\nshort term, to ignore the prick of conscience and let the small defeats\\nslide, day after day. This is not a good strategy. Only careful aim and\\nwakeful striving and commitment can eliminate the oft-incremental\\ncalamity of willful blindness, stem the entropic tide, and keep\\ncatastrophe—familial and social alike—at bay.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nCorruption of the form we are discussing is, in my opinion, integrally\\nlinked to deception—to lying, more bluntly—and more important, to\\nself-deception. Now, strict logicians regard self-deception as an\\nimpossibility. They cannot understand how it is possible for a person\\nto believe one thing and its opposite simultaneously. Logicians are\\nnot psychologists, however—and they obviously do not notice, or else\\nfail to take into account, the fact that they themselves have family\\nmembers, for example, for whom they at least occasionally feel love\\nand hate at the same time. Furthermore, it is not obvious what\\n“believe” means when discussing human belief, nor what is meant by\\n\\n\\x0c“simultaneously.” I can believe one thing today and another\\ntomorrow and very often get away with it, at least in the short term.\\nAnd on many occasions I have experienced what was very nearly\\nsimultaneous belief in one thing and its opposite while reading\\nundergraduate university papers, in which the writer made a claim in\\none paragraph and a completely contradictory claim in the next.\\n(Sometimes that happened within the span of a single sentence.)\\nThere are many conditions or circumstances under which self-\\ndeception can theoretically occur. Psychoanalysts have explored\\nmany of these, with Freud leading the way. Freud believed that much\\nof mental illness was due to repression, which is arguably and\\nreasonably considered a form of self-deception. For him, memories\\nof traumatically troubling events were unconsciously banished to\\nperdition in the unconscious, where they rattled around and caused\\ntrouble, like poltergeists in a dungeon. Freud understood that the\\nhuman personality was not unitary. Instead, it consists of a loose,\\nfragmented cacophony of spirits, who do not always agree or even\\ncommunicate. The truth of this claim is self-evident, at least in one\\nsimple manner: we can think about things—we can simulate\\npotential or alternative actions or events—without immediately\\nhaving to act them out. Dissociation of thought and action is\\nnecessary for abstract thought even to exist. Thus, we can clearly\\nthink or say one thing and do another. This is fine when merely\\nthinking, prior to acting, but perhaps not so good when we promise\\nor claim to believe something and then act in a manner indicating\\nthat we truly have faith in something else. This is a form of\\ndeception, a disjunction in character, a contradiction between modes\\nof being. It has even been named: to claim one belief and then to act\\n(or speak) in a different or even opposite manner constitutes a\\nperformative contradiction, according to certain modern\\nphilosophers:1 an implicit lie, in my opinion. The holding of\\ncontradictory beliefs also becomes a problem when the holder\\nattempts to act out both simultaneously and discovers, often to his or\\nher great chagrin, the paradox that makes such an attempt\\nimpossible.\\n\\nFreud catalogued an extensive list of phenomena akin to\\n\\nrepression—the active rejection of potentially conscious\\npsychological material from awareness—which he termed “defense\\nmechanisms.” These include denial (“the truth is not so bad”),\\n\\n\\x0creaction formation (“I really, really, really love my mother”),\\ndisplacement (“the boss yells at me, I yell at my wife, my wife yells at\\nthe baby, the baby bites the cat”), identification (“I am bullied, so I\\nam motivated to be a bully”), rationalization (a self-serving\\nexplanation for a low-quality action), intellectualization (a favorite of\\nthe early, funny, neurotic Woody Allen), sublimation (“I can always\\npaint nude women”), and projection (“I am not touchy; you are just\\nannoying”). Freud was an outstanding philosopher of deceit. He was\\nnot afraid to point out the relationship between dishonesty and\\npsychopathology. Nonetheless, his ideas of self-deception suffer, in\\nmy opinion, from two major errors.\\n\\nFirst error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission contributed\\n\\nto mental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of commission,\\nlisted above, that constitute repression. In doing so, he merely\\nthought in the typical manner. People generally believe that actively\\ndoing something bad (that is the sin of commission) is, on average,\\nworse than passively not doing something good (that is the sin of\\nomission). Perhaps this is because there are always good things we\\nare not doing; some sins of omission are therefore inevitable. In any\\ncase, there are still times when willful blindness nonetheless\\nproduces more serious catastrophes, more easily rationalized away,\\nthan the active or the unconscious repression of something terrible\\nbut understood (the latter being a sin of commission, because it is\\nknown). The former problem—willful blindness—occurs when you\\ncould come to know something but cease exploring so that you fail to\\ndiscover something that might cause you substantial discomfort.\\nSpin doctors call this self-imposed ignorance “plausible deniability,”\\nwhich is a phrase that indicates intellectualized rationalization of the\\nmost pathological order. It should be noted that such blindness is\\noften regarded as an outright crime. If you are a CEO, for example,\\nand you suspect that your treasurer is cooking the books, and you do\\nnot investigate because you do not want to know, you may still be\\nliable for your inaction—as is appropriate. Failing to look under the\\nbed when you strongly suspect a monster is lurking there is not an\\nadvisable strategy.\\n\\nSecond error: Freud assumed that things experienced are things\\nunderstood. In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a\\nmemory trace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately\\nrepresented the past, like an objective video recording. These would\\n\\n\\x0cbe reasonable presumptions, if our experience was simply a series of\\nobjectively real and self-evident events transmitted through our\\nsenses, thought about, evaluated, and then acted upon. If this was all\\ntrue, traumatic experience would be accurately represented in\\nmemory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious\\nmechanisms (or conscious—but Freud presumed the former)\\nbecause of its understood but terrible nature. However, neither\\nreality nor our processing of reality is as objective or articulated as\\nFreud presupposed.\\n\\nImagine, for example, that you have been ignored, romantically—\\n\\nmore than you can tolerate—for several months by your wife or\\nhusband. Then you encounter him or her leaning over the fence,\\ntalking in a friendly manner (and perhaps no more than that) to an\\nattractive neighbor. How we process such anomalous, novel,\\ntroublesome, or even traumatic experience is very rarely a matter of\\nperception, followed by conscious understanding and thought, then\\nemotion or motivation derived from that thought, then action. What\\nhappens instead is akin to what we discussed at length in Rule I and\\nRule II: We process the unknown world from the bottom up. We\\nencounter containers of information, so to speak, whose full import\\nis by no means self-evident. Upon witnessing your spouse talking to\\nthe neighbor, therefore, it is not as if you think, in an altogether\\narticulated and fully developed philosophical form: “I have been\\nlonesome and deprived physically for months by my spouse.\\nAlthough I have not said anything in detail, this has caused me\\nconstant frustration and pain. Now he (or she) is rubbing it in, as far\\nas I am concerned, by being so outgoing with a comparative stranger\\nwhen I have experienced so little attention.” It is much more likely\\nthat anger, grief, and loneliness have accumulated within you with\\neach rejection, bit by bit, until you are filled to the brim—and, now,\\noverflowing.\\n\\nThat sudden appearance of negative emotion does not necessarily\\nmean that you are even now fully conscious of its accumulation. You\\nmay well (as in the case of my father-in-law, or my client) have\\nexperienced the frustration build up gradually enough so that you\\nfound yourself more irritable and unhappy, but that does not\\nnecessarily mean that you noticed the cause. And what is the cause?\\nThe range of possibilities is uncomfortably broad. Perhaps you are\\nnot being ignored at all. Instead, you have been having trouble at\\n\\n\\x0cwork, and that has produced a decrease in your overall confidence.\\nIn consequence, you have become sensitized to any signs of rejection,\\neven imaginary, within your marriage. So, what you must determine\\nis not so much why your wife or husband is no longer attentive to\\nyou, but what it is about your boss, colleagues, or career that is\\ndestabilizing you. That puts the true cause of your discomfort a long\\ndistance away from the symptoms (the feelings of rejection) that are\\nmaking you irritable, sensitive, and hurt. There is nothing obvious\\nabout the relationship between cause and effect in such cases.\\nPerhaps you really are being ignored, just as you suspect. Perhaps it\\nis a sign of an impending affair and a manifestation of the trajectory\\nthat leads to divorce. Both of those, if true, are serious problems. It is\\nno wonder you are upset. But you may remain stubbornly unwilling\\nto consider that your career or marriage is in trouble. And that is no\\nsurprise. But it is not helpful.\\n\\nOn top of all that is the general complexity of life, complicating the\\n\\nsearch for clarity. Consider the question “What really happened?”\\nsay, in a failed marriage, divorce, and child-custody battle. The\\nanswer to that query is so complex that settling the disagreements\\nfrequently requires court evaluation and multi-party assessment.\\nEven then, one or even both of the protagonists is unlikely to believe\\nthat the truth has been served. This is partly because events in\\ngeneral and interpersonal events specifically do not exist as simple,\\nobjective facts, independent of one another. Everything depends for\\nits meaning—for the information it truly represents—on the context\\nin which it is embedded, much of which is not available for\\nperception or consideration when the event in question occurs. The\\nmeaning of what someone’s wife says to him today is dependent on\\neverything both have ever said to each other, everything they have\\never done together, and the contents of their mutual imaginations—\\nand that does not exhaust the complexity. Such meaning may even\\nbe importantly dependent on how, for example, the wife’s mother\\ntreated her father (or her grandmother treated her grandfather), as\\nwell as the relationship between men and women in the broader\\nculture. That is why domestic arguments so often spiral out of\\ncontrol, particularly when a pattern of continual and effective\\ncommunication has never been established. One thing leads to a\\ndeeper thing, and that leads deeper yet, until an argument that\\nstarted over what size plates are best used at lunchtime turns into a\\n\\n\\x0cno-holds-barred war about whether the marriage in question would\\nbe better dissolved. And there is certainly fear of falling down a hole\\nof that size (again, particularly when much has remained unspoken)\\nthat motivates the proclivity to keep things to yourself when they\\nwould be better, but dangerously, said.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nImagine that you are afraid. You have reason to be. You are afraid of\\nyourself. You are afraid of other people. You are afraid of the world.\\nYou are nostalgic for the innocence of the past; for the time before\\nyou learned the terrible things that shattered the trust characterizing\\nyour childhood. The knowledge you have gained of yourself, other\\npeople, and the world has embittered more than enlightened. You\\nhave been betrayed, hurt, and disappointed. You have become\\ndistrustful even of hope itself, as your hope has been repeatedly\\nshattered (and that is the very definition of hopelessness). The last\\nthing you want is to know more. Better to leave what is enshrouded\\nin mystery. Better, as well, to avoid thinking too much (or at all)\\nabout what could be. When ignorance is bliss, after all, ’tis folly to be\\nwise.\\n\\nImagine, more precisely, that you are so afraid that you will not\\n\\nallow yourself even to know what you want. Knowing would\\nsimultaneously mean hoping, and your hopes have been dashed. You\\nhave your reasons for maintaining your ignorance. You are afraid,\\nperhaps, that there is nothing worth wanting; you are afraid that if\\nyou specify what you want precisely you will simultaneously discover\\n(and all too clearly) what constitutes failure; you are afraid that\\nfailure is the most likely outcome; and, finally, you are afraid that if\\nyou define failure and then fail, you will know beyond a shadow of a\\ndoubt that it was you that failed, and that it was your fault.\\n\\nSo, you do not allow yourself to know what you want. You manage\\n\\nthis by refusing to think it through. You are happy, satisfied, and\\nengaged sometimes and unhappy, frustrated, and nihilistic other\\ntimes, but you will not enquire deeply into why, because then you\\nwould know, and then you would encounter yet-again shattered hope\\nand confirmed disappointment. You are also afraid, but for different\\nreasons, to allow others to know what you want. First, if they were to\\n\\n\\x0cfind out just what you wanted, then they might tell you, and then you\\nwould know, even if you were fighting against gathering that very\\nknowledge. Second, if they knew, they could then deny you what you\\ntruly wanted, even needed, and hurt you much more efficiently than\\nthey might if your deepest desires (and, therefore, your\\nvulnerabilities) remained secret.\\n\\nThe fog that hides is the refusal to notice—to attend to—emotions\\nand motivational states as they arise, and the refusal to communicate\\nthem both to yourself and to the people who are close to you. A bad\\nmood signifies something. A state of anxiety or sadness signifies\\nsomething, and not likely something that will please you to discover.\\nThe most probable outcome of successfully articulating an emotion\\nthat has accrued without expression over time is tears—an admission\\nof vulnerability and pain (which are also feelings that people do not\\nlike to allow, particularly when they are feeling distrustful and\\nangry). Who wants to dig down into the depths of pain and grief and\\nguilt until the tears emerge? And voluntary refusal to take notice of\\nour emotional states is not the only impediment to dealing with\\nthem. If your wife or husband (or whomever else you are tangled up\\nwith, unhappily, at the moment) says something that comes too close\\nto the painful truth, for example, then a sharp and insulting remark\\nwill often shut them up—and is therefore very likely to be offered.\\nThis is partly a test: does the person being insulted care enough\\nabout you and your suffering to dig past a few obstacles and unearth\\nthe bitter truth? It is also partly, and more obviously, defensive: if\\nyou can chase someone away from something you yourself do not\\nwant to discover, that makes your life easier in the present. Sadly, it\\nis also very disappointing if that defense succeeds, and is typically\\naccompanied by a sense of abandonment, loneliness, and self-\\nbetrayal. You must nonetheless still live among other people, and\\nthey with you. And you have desires, wants, and needs, however\\nunstated and unclear. And you are still motivated to pursue them,\\nnot least because it is impossible to live without desire, want, and\\nneed.\\u2029Your strategy, under such conditions? Show your\\ndisappointment whenever someone close to you makes you unhappy;\\nallow yourself the luxury and pleasure of resentment when\\nsomething does not go your way; ensure that the person who has\\ntransgressed against you is frozen out by your disapproval; force\\n\\n\\x0cthem to discover with as much difficulty as possible exactly what they\\nhave done to disappoint you; and, finally, let them grope around\\nblindly in the fog that you have generated around yourself until they\\nstumble into and injure themselves on the sharp hidden edges of\\nyour unrevealed preferences and dreams. And maybe these\\nresponses are tests, too—tests deeply associated with the lack of\\ncourage to trust: “If you really loved me, you would brave the terrible\\nlandscape that I have arrayed around myself to discover the real me.”\\nAnd perhaps there is even something to such claims, implicit though\\nthey may be. A certain testing of commitment might have its utility.\\nEverything does not have to be given away for free. But even a little\\nunnecessary mystery goes a long way.\\n\\nAnd you still must live with yourself. In the short term, perhaps\\nyou are protected from the revelation of your insufficiency by your\\nrefusal to make yourself clear. Every ideal is a judge, after all: the\\njudge who says, “You are not manifesting your true potential.” No\\nideals? No judge. But the price paid for that is purposelessness. This\\nis a high price. No purpose? Then, no positive emotion, as most of\\nwhat drives us forward with hope intact is the experience of\\napproaching something we deeply need and want. And worse, when\\nwe are without purpose: chronic, overwhelming anxiety, as focused\\npurpose constrains what is otherwise likely to be the intolerable\\nchaos of unexploited possibility and too much choice.\\n\\nIf you make what you want clear and commit yourself to its\\npursuit, you may fail. But if you do not make what you want clear,\\nthen you will certainly fail. You cannot hit a target that you refuse to\\nsee. You cannot hit a target if you do not take aim. And, equally\\ndangerously, in both cases: you will not accrue the advantage of\\naiming, but missing. You will not benefit from the learning that\\ninevitably takes place when things do not go your way. Success at a\\ngiven endeavor often means trying, falling short, recalibrating (with\\nthe new knowledge generated painfully by the failure), and then\\ntrying again and falling short—often repeated, ad nauseam.\\nSometimes all that learning, impossible without the failure, leads you\\nto see that aiming your ambition in a different direction would be\\nbetter (not because it is easier; not because you have given up; not\\nbecause you are avoiding—but because you have learned through the\\nvicissitudes of your experience that what you seek is not to be found\\n\\n\\x0cwhere you were looking, or is simply not attainable in the manner by\\nwhich you chose to pursue it).\\n\\nSo, what might you do—what should you do—as an alternative to\\nhiding things in the fog? Admit to your feelings. This is a very tricky\\nmatter (and it does not simply mean “give in” to them). First, noting,\\nmuch less communicating, feelings of (petty) anger or pain due to\\nlonesomeness, or anxiety about something that might be trivial, or\\njealousy that is likely unwarranted is embarrassing. The admission of\\nsuch feelings is a revelation of ignorance, insufficiency, and\\nvulnerability. Second, it is unsettling to allow for the possibility that\\nyour feelings, however overwhelming and convincing, might be\\nmisplaced and, in your ignorance, pointing you in the wrong\\ndirection. It is possible that you have misinterpreted the situation\\nentirely, for reasons of which you remain fundamentally\\nunconscious. It is for such reasons that trust is vital: but trust of the\\nmature and tragic sort. A naive person trusts because he or she\\nbelieves that people are essentially or even universally trustworthy.\\nBut any person who has truly lived has been—or has—betrayed.\\nSomeone with experience knows that people are capable of\\ndeception and willing to deceive. That knowledge brings with it an\\narguably justified pessimism about human nature, personal and\\notherwise, but it also opens the door to another kind of faith in\\nhumanity: one based on courage, rather than naivete. I will trust you\\n—I will extend my hand to you—despite the risk of betrayal, because\\nit is possible, through trust, to bring out the best in you, and perhaps\\nin me. So, I will accept substantial risk to open the door to\\ncooperation and negotiation. And even if you do betray me, in a not-\\ntoo unforgivable manner (assuming a certain degree, shall we say, of\\ngenuine apology and contrition on your part), I will continue to\\nextend my hand. And part of the way I will do that is by telling you\\nwhat I am feeling.\\n\\nA certain necessary humility must accompany such raw\\n\\nrevelations. I should not say—at least not ideally—“You have been\\nignoring me lately.” I should say, instead, “I feel isolated and lonely\\nand hurt, and cannot help but feel that you have not been as attentive\\nto me over the last few months as I would have liked or that might\\nhave been best for us as a couple. But I am unsure if I am just\\nimagining all this because I am upset or if I am genuinely seeing\\nwhat is going on.” The latter statement gets the point across, but\\n\\n\\x0cavoids the accusatory stance that so often serves as the first defense\\nagainst a serious, get-to-the-bottom-of-things conversation. And it is\\nvery possible that you are wrong about just what is causing you to\\nfeel the way you do. If you are, you need to know it, because there is\\nno point in propagating errors that are causing you and others pain\\nand interfering with your future. Best to find out what is true—best\\nto disperse the fog—and find out if the sharp objects you feared were\\nlurking there are real or fantastical. And there is always the danger\\nthat some of them are real. But it is better to see them than to keep\\nthem occluded by the fog, because you can at least sometimes avoid\\nthe danger that you are willing to see.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nEvents, as they lay themselves out in front of us, do not simply\\ninform us of why they occur, and we do not remember the past in\\norder to objectively record bounded, well-defined events and\\nsituations. The latter act is impossible, in any case. The information\\nin our experience is latent, like gold in ore—the case we made in Rule\\nII. It must be extracted and refined with great effort, and often in\\ncollaboration with other people, before it can be employed to\\nimprove the present and the future. We use our past effectively when\\nit helps us repeat desirable—and avoid repeating undesirable—\\nexperiences. We want to know what happened but, more\\nimportantly, we want to know why. Why is wisdom. Why enables us\\nto avoid making the same mistake again and again, and if we are\\nfortunate helps us repeat our successes.\\n\\nExtracting useful information from experience is difficult. It\\nrequires the purest of motivations (“things should be made better,\\nnot worse”) to perform it properly. It requires the willingness to\\nconfront error, forthrightly, and to determine at what point and why\\ndeparture from the proper path occurred. It requires the willingness\\nto change, which is almost always indistinguishable from the\\ndecision to leave something (or someone, or some idea) behind.\\nTherefore, the simplest response imaginable is to look away and\\nrefuse to think, while simultaneously erecting unsurmountable\\nimpediments to genuine communication.\\n\\n\\x0cUnfortunately, in the longer term, this willful blindness leaves life\\n\\nmurky and foggy; leaves it void, unseen, without form, confused—\\nand leaves you bewildered and astonished.2 This is all a strange\\nconcatenation of the psychological and the real, the subjective and\\nthe objective. Is something frightening, or am I afraid? Is something\\nbeautiful, or am I imposing the idea of beauty upon it? When I\\nbecome angry with someone, is it because of something they have\\ndone, or my lack of control? Such questions define the state of\\nconfusion you occupy chronically when the bottom has fallen out of\\nyour world. That state can have an objective element, because a fall is\\noften caused by something real, such as a death, a serious illness, or\\na bout of unemployment; but it is also subjective, associated with a\\nstate composed of pain, doubt, confusion, and the inability to choose\\n—or even perceive—a path forward.\\n\\nThe ground of Being is subject and object simultaneously—\\n\\nmotivation, emotion, and material thing all at once—before\\nperception is clarified, before the world is articulated. The wife\\nremains uncomprehended. The context of her speech remains\\nunexplored, for fear of what that exploration might reveal. The\\nsituation cannot be described because the word is left vague and\\nunformed. Our own personal motivations begin in hidden form, and\\nremain that way, because we do not want to know what we are up to.\\nThe wheat remains unseparated from the chaff. The gold remains in\\nthe clutches of the dragon, as does the virgin. The philosopher’s\\nstone remains undiscovered in the gutter; and the information\\nhidden in the round chaos, beckoning, remains unexplored. Such\\nomission is the voluntary refusal of expanded consciousness. After\\nall, the pathway to the Holy Grail has its beginnings in the darkest\\npart of the forest, and what you need remains hidden where you least\\nwant to look.\\n\\nIf you pile up enough junk in your closet, one day, when you are\\nleast prepared, the door will spring open, and all of what has been\\npacked inside, growing inexorably in the darkness, will bury you, and\\nyou may not have enough time or energy left in your life to confront\\nit, sort through it, keep what you need, and discard the rest. This is\\nwhat it means to be crushed under excess baggage. This is the return\\nof Tiamat, the great Mesopotamian Goddess of Chaos, destroyer of\\nthose who act improperly.\\n\\n\\x0cThe world is full of hidden dangers and obstacles—and\\n\\nopportunities. Leaving everything hidden in the fog because you are\\nafraid of the danger you may find there will be of little help when fate\\nforces you to run headlong toward what you have refused to see.\\nImpaling yourself on sharp branches, stumbling over boulders, and\\nrushing by places of sanctuary, you will finally refuse to admit you\\ncould have burned away the haze with the bright light of your\\nconsciousness, had you not hidden it under a bushel. Then you will\\ncome to curse man, reality, and God himself for producing such an\\nimpenetrable maze of impediments and barriers. Corruption will\\nbeckon to you, led as you increasingly will be by dark, unexamined\\nmotivations—bred by failure, amplified by frustration—viciously\\nculminating in the resentful belief that those who have transgressed\\nagainst you are getting from you exactly what they deserve. This\\nattitude and the actions and inactions it will inevitably produce will\\nimpoverish your life, your community, your nation, and the world.\\nThis will in turn impoverish Being itself (and that will be exactly\\nwhat your darkest unexamined motivations desire).\\n\\nWith careful searching, with careful attention, you might tip the\\nbalance toward opportunity and against obstacle sufficiently so that\\nlife is clearly worth living, despite its fragility and suffering. If you\\ntruly wanted, perhaps you would receive, if you asked. If you truly\\nsought, perhaps you would find what you seek. If you knocked, truly\\nwanting to enter, perhaps the door would open. But there will be\\ntimes in your life when it will take everything you have to face what is\\nin front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth so terrible that\\nthe only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it with.\\n\\nDo not hide unwanted things in the fog.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nNOTICE THAT OPPORTUNITY LURKS WHERE\\nRESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN ABDICATED\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIn my dual role as clinical psychologist and professor, I have coached\\nmany people in the development of their careers. Sometimes those I\\nam coaching consult me because their coworkers, subordinates, or\\nbosses will not do their jobs properly. They are supervised by,\\nworking alongside, or managing people who are narcissistic,\\nincompetent, malevolent, or tyrannical. Such things happen and\\nmust be dealt with in whatever reasonable manner will bring them to\\na halt. I do not encourage people to martyr themselves. It is a bad\\nidea to sacrifice yourself uncomplainingly so that someone else can\\ntake the credit. Nonetheless, under such circumstances—if you are a\\nwise and attentive person—you might still notice that your\\nunproductive coworkers are leaving a plethora of valuable tasks\\nundone. You might then ask yourself, “What would happen if I took\\nresponsibility for doing them?” It is a daunting question. What is left\\nundone is often risky, difficult, and necessary. But that also means—\\ndoes it not?—that it is worthwhile and significant. And you may have\\nthe eyes to see that there is a problem, despite your all-too-frequent\\nblindness. How do you know that it is not, therefore, your problem?\\nWhy do you notice this issue and not some other? This is a question\\nworth considering in depth.\\n\\nIf you want to become invaluable in a workplace—in any\\n\\ncommunity—just do the useful things no one else is doing. Arrive\\nearlier and leave later than your compatriots (but do not deny\\nyourself your life).1 Organize what you can see is dangerously\\n\\n\\x0cdisorganized. Work, when you are working, instead of looking like\\nyou are working. And finally, learn more about the business—or your\\ncompetitors—than you already know. Doing so will make you\\ninvaluable—a veritable lynchpin. People will notice that and begin to\\nappreciate your hard-earned merits.\\n\\nYou might object, “Well, I just could not manage to take on\\n\\nsomething that important.” What if you began to build yourself into a\\nperson who could? You could start by trying to solve a small problem\\n—something that is bothering you, that you think you could fix. You\\ncould start by confronting a dragon of just the size that you are likely\\nto defeat. A tiny serpent might not have had the time to hoard a lot of\\ngold, but there might still be some treasure to be won, along with a\\nreasonable probability of succeeding in such a quest (and not too\\nmuch chance of a fiery or toothsome death). Under reasonable\\ncircumstances, picking up the excess responsibility is an opportunity\\nto become truly invaluable. And then, if you want to negotiate for a\\nraise, or more autonomy—or more free time, for that matter—you\\ncan go to your boss and say, “Here are ten things that were crying out\\nto be done, each of them vital, and I am now doing all of them. If you\\nhelp me out a bit, I will continue. I might even improve. And\\neverything, including your life, will improve along with me.” And\\nthen, if your boss has any sense—and sometimes bosses do—then\\nyour negotiation will be successful. That is how such things work.\\nAnd do not forget that there is no shortage of genuinely good people\\nwho are thrilled if they can give someone useful and trustworthy a\\nhand up. It is one of the truly altruistic pleasures of life, and its depth\\nis not to be underestimated, or to be disregarded with the cheap\\ncynicism that masks itself as world-weary wisdom.\\n\\nIt appears that the meaning that most effectively sustains life is to\\nbe found in the adoption of responsibility. When people look back on\\nwhat they have accomplished, they think, if they are fortunate: “Well,\\nI did that, and it was valuable. It was not easy. But it was worth it.” It\\nis a strange and paradoxical fact that there is a reciprocal\\nrelationship between the worth of something and the difficulty of\\naccomplishing it. Imagine the following conversation: “Do you want\\ndifficulty?” “No, I want ease.” “In your experience, has doing\\nsomething easy been worthwhile?” “Well, no, not very often.” “Then\\nperhaps you really want something difficult.” I think that is the secret\\nto the reason for Being itself: difficult is necessary.\\n\\n\\x0cIt is for this reason that we voluntarily and happily place\\n\\nlimitations on ourselves. Every time we play a game, for example, we\\naccept a set of arbitrary restrictions. We narrow and limit ourselves,\\nand explore the possibilities thereby revealed. That is what makes\\nthe game. But it does not work without the arbitrary rules. You take\\nthem on voluntarily, absurdly, as in chess: “I can only move this\\nknight in an L. How ridiculous. But how fun!” Because it is not fun,\\noddly enough, if you can move any piece anywhere. It is not a game\\nanymore if you can make any old move at all. Accept some\\nlimitations, however, and the game begins. Accept them, more\\nbroadly speaking, as a necessary part of Being and a desirable part of\\nlife. Assume you can transcend them by accepting them. And then\\nyou can play the limited game properly.\\n\\nAnd this is all not merely of psychological import, and it is by no\\n\\nmeans just a game. People need meaning, but problems also need\\nsolving. It is very salutary, from the psychological perspective, to find\\nsomething of significance—something worth sacrificing for (or to),\\nsomething worth confronting and taking on. But the suffering and\\nmalevolence that characterize life are real, with the terrible\\nconsequences of the real—and our ability to solve problems, by\\nconfronting them and taking them on, is also real. By taking\\nresponsibility, we can find a meaningful path, improve our personal\\nlot psychologically, and make what is intolerably wrong genuinely\\nbetter. Thus, we can have our cake and eat it, too.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe idea that life is suffering is a relatively universal truism of\\nreligious thinking. This is the first of the Four Noble Truths of\\nBuddhism as well as a key Hindu concept. There is a tradition that\\nthe ancient Indian word for suffering—dukkha (from the Pali\\nlanguage) or duhka (from Sanskrit)—is derived from dus (bad) and\\nkha (hole)—particularly the hole in a horse-drawn cart wheel,\\nthrough which the axle passes. The proper place for such a hole is\\ndead center, right on target. The ride is likely to be very bumpy,\\notherwise—with the bumps directly proportional in magnitude to the\\ndegree of offset. This is quite reminiscent, to me, of the Greek term\\n\\n\\x0chamartia, which is frequently translated as “sin,” in the context of\\nChristian thought.\\n\\nHamartia was originally an archery term, and it meant to miss the\\n\\nmark or target. There are many ways that a target can be missed.\\nFrequently, in my clinical practice—and in my personal life—I\\nobserved that people did not get what they needed (or, equally\\nimportantly perhaps, what they wanted) because they never made it\\nclear to themselves or others what that was. It is impossible to hit a\\ntarget, after all, unless you aim at it. In keeping with this: People are\\nmore commonly upset by what they did not even try to do than by\\nthe errors they actively committed while engaging with the world.2 At\\nleast if you misstep while doing something, you can learn from doing\\nit wrong. But to remain passive in the face of life, even if you excuse\\nyour inaction as a means of avoiding error—that is a major mistake.\\nAs the great blues musician Tom Waits insists (in his song “A Little\\nRain”): “You must risk something that matters.”\\n\\nThis is the colossal blunder made, for example, by the fictional\\nPeter Pan. “Pan”—a name echoing the Greek god of the wilds—means\\n“encompassing everything.” Peter Pan, the magical boy, is capable of\\neverything. He is potential itself, like every child, and that makes him\\nmagical, in the same way that every child is magical. But time\\nwhittles that magic away, transforming the fascinating potentiality of\\nchildhood into the oft-apparently more mundane but genuine\\nactuality of adulthood. The trick, so to speak, is to trade that early\\npossibility for something meaningful, productive, long term, and\\nsustainable. Peter Pan refuses to do so. This is at least in part\\nbecause his major role model is Captain Hook. Captain Hook is the\\narchetypal Tyrannical King, the pathology of order—a parasite and a\\ntyrant, terrified of death. He has his reasons. Death stalks Hook in\\nthe form of a crocodile with a clock in his stomach. That is time:\\nticktock, ticktock. That is life vanishing, as the seconds march by.\\nThe crocodile has had a taste of Hook, too, and liked it. That is life, as\\nwell. It is not only cowards who are terrified by what lurks down in\\nthe chaotic depths. It is a rare person who has not suffered through\\ndisappointment, disease, and the death of a loved one by the time\\nchildhood ends. Such experiences can leave those who have had\\nthem bitter, resentful, predatory, and tyrannical—just like Hook.\\nWith a role model like the captain, it is no wonder Peter Pan does not\\nwant to grow up. Better to remain king of the Lost Boys. Better to\\n\\n\\x0cremain lost in fantasy with Tinkerbell, who provides everything a\\nfemale partner can provide—except that she does not exist.\\n\\nWendy, the great love of Pan’s life, chooses to grow up, despite her\\n\\nadmiration for her friend Peter. She takes a husband, facing—even\\nwelcoming—her maturation, and its lurking hints of mortality and\\ndeath. She consciously chooses to sacrifice her childhood for the\\nrealities of adulthood, but gains real life in return. Peter remains a\\nchild: magical, to be sure, but still a child—and life, limited, finite,\\nand unique, passes him by. In the J. M. Barrie play Peter Pan or The\\nBoy Who Would Not Grow Up, Pan is portrayed as unafraid of\\ndeath, which he faces on Marooners’ Rock. His attitude might be\\nmisunderstood by inattentive viewers as courage. After all, Pan says,\\n“To die will be an awfully big adventure.”* But the psychologically\\ninsightful unseen narrator objects: “To live would be an awfully big\\nadventure” (truly, a statement about what might have happened had\\nthe Boy King chosen Wendy), noting, immediately afterward, “but he\\ncan never quite get the hang of it.”* Pan’s hypothetical lack of fear of\\ndeath is not courage, but the manifestation of his basically suicidal\\nnature, the sickness of life (which he is constantly manifesting by his\\nvery refusal to mature).\\n\\nIt is by no means a good thing to be the oldest person at the frat\\nparty. It is desperation, masquerading as cool rebelliousness—and\\nthere is a touchy despondence and arrogance that goes along with it.\\nIt smacks of Neverland. In the same manner, the attractive potential\\nof a directionless but talented twenty-five-year-old starts to look\\nhopeless and pathetic at thirty, and downright past its expiration\\ndate at forty. You must sacrifice something of your manifold\\npotential in exchange for something real in life. Aim at something.\\nDiscipline yourself. Or suffer the consequence. And what is that\\nconsequence? All the suffering of life, with none of the meaning. Is\\nthere a better description of hell?\\n\\nLife is duhka for the Buddhists—equally, perhaps, although less\\n\\nexplicitly, for the Hindus. The Hebrew Scriptures, for their part,\\nchronicle the history of the suffering of the Jewish people,\\nindividually and as a nation, although the triumphs are not ignored.\\nEven those who are called on by YHWH Himself to move into the\\nadventure of life by no means escape catastrophe. Perhaps Abraham,\\nthe archetypal Patriarch, had an intuition of this. He was clearly\\nsomething of a Peter Pan himself. The biblical account insists that\\n\\n\\x0cAbraham stayed safely ensconced within his father’s tent until he was\\nseventy-five years old (a late start, even by today’s standards). Then,\\ncalled by God—inspired by the voice within, let us say, to leave family\\nand country—he journeys forward into life. And what does he\\nencounter, after heeding the divine call to adventure? First, famine.\\nThen tyranny in Egypt; the potential loss of his beautiful wife to\\nmore powerful men; exile from his adopted country; conflicts over\\nterritory with his kinsmen; war, and the kidnapping of his nephew;\\nextended childlessness (despite God’s promise to make him the\\nprogenitor of a great nation); and finally, terrible conflict between\\nhis spouses.\\n\\nThe Abrahamic story made a great impact on me when I began to\\n\\nstudy and appreciate it more deeply. It has at its core a strange\\ncombination of pessimism and realistic, genuine encouragement.\\nThe pessimism? Even if you are called by God Himself to venture out\\ninto the world, as Abraham was, life is going to be exceptionally\\ndifficult. Even under the best of all conceivable circumstances,\\nalmost insuperable obstacles will emerge and obstruct your path.\\nThe encouragement? You will have the opportunity to reveal yourself\\nas much stronger and more competent than you might imagine.\\nThere is a potential within you (some of that magic so evident in\\nchildhood) that will emerge when circumstances demand and\\ntransform you—God willing—into someone who can prevail.\\n\\nThere is a very old idea, which I have only recently come to\\n\\ncomprehend, at least in part. It is something you see manifested in\\nmany literary, imagistic, and dramatic forms, ancient and modern. It\\nhas to do with responsibility and meaning, but its true significance\\nappears hidden, in precisely the same way that the wisdom dreams\\ncan bring forth is so often hidden. It is associated with the\\nlabyrinthine myth of the hero: He who speaks magic words, sees\\nwhat others cannot (or refuse to see), overcomes the giant, leads his\\npeople, slays the dragon, finds the treasure hard to attain, and\\nrescues the virgin. These are all variants of the same perceptual and\\nbehavioral pattern, which is an outline of the universally adaptive\\npattern of being. The hero is also he who rescues his father from the\\nbelly of the beast. What could this idea, expressed so commonly in\\nnarrative form, possibly mean?\\n\\n\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nConsider the ancient Egyptian story of Osiris, Set, Isis, and Horus.*\\nThe Egyptians regarded Osiris as the founding deity of the state. You\\ncan profitably consider him to be an amalgam of all the personality\\ncharacteristics of all the people who established the astonishing\\ncivilization on the Nile River. Osiris was worshipped as the culture-\\nestablishing hero, whose world-creating exploits as a young, vibrant\\ngod produced one of the first great and enduring civilizations. But he\\naged, as all things do, and became willfully blind. The Egyptians\\ninsisted that this crucially important figure in their mythology\\npossessed both of these attributes—and that insistence constituted a\\ngreat truth. The great founder-god became anachronistic but, more\\nimportantly, he began to close his eyes when he knew full well he\\nshould have kept them open. Osiris stopped paying attention to how\\nhis kingdom was being run. That was willful blindness, and there is\\nno blaming that on mere age. It is a terrible temptation, as it allows\\nfor the sequestration into the future the trouble we could face today.\\nThat would be fine if trouble did not compound, like interest—but we\\nall know that it does.\\n\\nOsiris’s decision to close his eyes when he should have kept them\\nopen exacted a brutally heavy price: subjugation to his evil brother,\\nSet. The idea that the state had a malevolent brother was an axiom,\\nwe might say, of the Egyptian worldview—no doubt the consequence\\nof a complex, long-standing civilization observing its own flaws—and\\nsomething that has retained its relevance to the current day. Once a\\nproperly functional hierarchy has been established, an opportunity\\nopens for its positions of authority to be usurped, not by people who\\nhave the competence demanded by the task at hand, but by those\\nwilling to use manipulation, deceit, and compulsion to gain status\\nand control. It was all those counterproductive forces that the\\nEgyptians were attempting to conceptualize in the figure of Set, the\\nenemy of illumination, enlightenment, vision, and consciousness.3 It\\nwas Set’s greatest ambition to rule Egypt, to take the place of the\\nrightful Pharaoh. By turning a blind eye to his evil brother’s\\nmachinations—by refusing to see—Osiris allowed Set to gain\\nstrength. This proved fatal (or as fatal as an error can be to an\\nimmortal). Set bided his time, until he caught Osiris in a moment of\\nweakness. Then he dismembered him and scattered the pieces over\\n\\n\\x0cthe Egyptian countryside. It was not (is not) possible to finally kill\\nOsiris, the eternal human impulse toward social organization. That is\\na force that will not die. But it is possible to break him into pieces—to\\nmake it difficult for him to get his act together—and that is exactly\\nwhat Set managed.\\n\\nOsiris, god of order, falls apart. This happens all the time, in\\n\\npeople’s individual lives, and equally in the history of families, cities,\\nand states. Things fall apart when love affairs collapse, careers\\ndeteriorate, or cherished dreams die; when despair, anxiety,\\nuncertainty, and hopelessness manifest themselves in the place of\\nhabitable order; and when nihilism and the abyss make their dread\\nappearance, destroying the desirable and stable values of current life.\\nUnder such circumstances, chaos emerges. And that is why the\\ngoddess Isis, Queen of the Underworld and consort of Osiris, makes\\nher appearance when Osiris is destroyed by Set. Isis scours the\\ncountryside, searching for the vital essence of Osiris. She finds it in\\nthe form of his dismembered phallus—vessel of the seminal idea, the\\nspermatic word, the fructifying principle—and makes herself\\npregnant. What does this mean? The queen of the underworld, the\\ngoddess of chaos, is also the force that eternally renews. All the\\npotential constrained by the previous system of apprehension, of\\ncategory, of assumption—all the invisible limitation imposed upon\\nthe inhabitants of that orderly state—is released, for better and\\nworse, when that system breaks into pieces. Thus, when the center\\nwill no longer hold—even at the darkest hour—new possibility makes\\nitself manifest. It is for this reason that the archetypal Hero is born\\nwhen things are at their worst.\\n\\nThe now pregnant Isis returns to her home in the underworld and\\n\\ngives birth, in due time, to Horus, rightful son of the long-lost king,\\nalienated as he matures from his now corrupted kingdom (something\\nwe all experience during our maturation). His primary attribute is\\nthe eye—the famous Egyptian single eye—while his avatar is the\\nfalcon, a bird that takes precise aim at its prey, strikes the target with\\ndeadly accuracy, and possesses an acuity of vision unparalleled in the\\nkingdom of living things. More importantly, however, Horus has the\\nwill to see, along with the ability. This is courage itself: the refusal to\\nshrink from what makes itself known, no matter how terrible it\\nseems. Horus is the great god of attention, and the Egyptians\\ndetermined, in their strange narrative manner—in a form of\\n\\n\\x0cimaginative thinking that stretched over thousands of years—that the\\nfaculty of attention should rule over all others. Horus differs from\\nOsiris, his father, in his willingness to see. He sees his uncle Set, for\\nexample, precisely for what he is. Set is pure malevolence; evil itself.\\nNonetheless, upon his maturity, Horus returns to the kingdom\\nusurped from his father and confronts his uncle. They engage in an\\nepic battle. The young god and rightful heir to the throne sees the\\nopportunity lurking where responsibility has been abdicated, and is\\nunwilling to look away. This is no feat for the faint of heart—not\\nwhen it is taken all the way to its logical conclusion; not when the\\ncorruption and the willful blindness is exposed, all the way to the\\nbottom. To look upon evil with eyes unshielded is dangerous beyond\\nbelief, regardless of how necessary it is to look. This is represented by\\nHorus’s initial partial defeat: During their confrontation, Set tears\\nout one of his courageous nephew’s eyes.\\n\\nDespite the damage he sustains, Horus emerges victorious. It is of\\n\\nvital importance to reiterate, in light of this victory, the fact that he\\nenters the battle voluntarily. It is a maxim of clinical intervention—a\\nconsequence of observation of improvement in mental health across\\nmany schools of practical psychological thought—that voluntary\\nconfrontation with a feared, hated, or despised obstacle is curative.\\nWe become stronger by voluntarily facing what impedes our\\nnecessary progress. This does not mean “bite off more than you can\\nchew” (any more than “voluntarily enter battle” means “seek conflict\\ncarelessly”). We are well advised to take on challenges at precisely\\nthe rate that engages and compels alertness, and forces the\\ndevelopment of courage, skill, and talent, and to avoid foolhardy\\nconfrontation with that which lies beyond current comprehension.\\n\\nHow is it possible to gauge the rate at which challenges should be\\n\\nsought? It is the instinct for meaning—something far deeper and\\nolder than mere thought—that holds the answer. Does what you are\\nattempting compel you forward, without being too frightening? Does\\nit grip your interest, without crushing you? Does it eliminate the\\nburden of time passing? Does it serve those you love and, perhaps,\\neven bring some good to your enemies? That is responsibility.\\nConstrain evil. Reduce suffering. Confront the possibility that\\nmanifests in front of you every second of your life with the desire to\\nmake things better, regardless of the burden you bear, regardless of\\nlife’s often apparently arbitrary unfairness and cruelty. All other\\n\\n\\x0capproaches merely deepen the pit, increase its heat, and doom those\\nwho inhabit it to continual worsening of their already serious\\nproblems. Everyone knows it. Everyone’s conscience proclaims it.\\nEveryone’s true friend or loved one observes it and despairs when\\nthey see someone for whom they care failing to do what needs to be\\ndone.\\n\\nHorus takes his eye back from the defeated Set and banishes him\\n\\nbeyond the borders of the kingdom. There is no killing Set. He is\\neternal as Osiris, eternal as Isis and Horus. The evil that threatens at\\nall levels of experience is something—or someone—that everyone has\\nto contend with always, psychologically and socially. But for a time\\nevil can be overcome, banished, and defeated. Then peace and\\nharmony can prevail for as long as people do not forget what brought\\nthem both about.\\n\\nHorus recovers his eye. A sensible person, in such a situation,\\nwould thank his lucky stars, place his eye back into its empty socket,\\nand get on with his life. But that is not what Horus does. He returns,\\ninstead, to the underworld, to the belly of the beast, to the kingdom\\nof the dead, where he knows he will find the spirit of Osiris.\\nDismembered though he may be, near death—even dead, in a sense—\\nOsiris inhabits the underworld domain of chaos itself. That is the\\ndead father in the belly of the beast. Horus finds the once-great king\\nand grants to him the eye torn out by Set. Once again—because of the\\nsacrifice and vision of his son—the ancient of days can see. Horus\\nthen takes his father, vision restored, and returns with him to the\\nkingdom, so they can rule in tandem. The Egyptians insisted that it\\nwas this combination of vision, courage, and regenerated tradition\\nthat constituted the proper sovereign of the kingdom. It was this\\njuxtaposition of wisdom and youth that comprised the essence of the\\npower of the Pharaoh, his immortal soul, the source of his authority.\\nWhen you face a challenge, you grapple with the world and inform\\n\\nyourself. This makes you more than you are. It makes you\\nincreasingly into who you could be. Who could you be? You could be\\nall that a man or woman might be. You could be the newest avatar, in\\nyour own unique manner, of the great ancestral heroes of the past.\\nWhat is the upper limit to that? We do not know. Our religious\\nstructures hint at it. What would a human being who was completely\\nturned on, so to speak, be like? How would someone who determined\\nto take full responsibility for the tragedy and malevolence of the\\n\\n\\x0cworld manifest himself? The ultimate question of Man is not who we\\nare, but who we could be.\\n\\nWhen you peer into an abyss, you see a monster. If it is a small\\nabyss, then it is a small monster. But if it is the ultimate abyss, then it\\nis the ultimate monster. That is certainly a dragon—perhaps even the\\ndragon of evil itself. The conceptualization of the monster in the\\nabyss is the eternal predator lurking in the night, ready and able to\\ndevour its unsuspecting prey. That is an image that is tens of millions\\nof years old, something coded as deeply in the recesses of our\\nbiological structure as anything conceptual can be coded. And it is\\nnot just the monsters of nature, but the tyrants of culture and the\\nmalevolence of individuals. It is all of that, with the latter dominant,\\nterrible as that is to consider. And it is in the nature of mankind not\\nto cower and freeze as helpless prey animals, nor to become a\\nturncoat and serve evil itself, but to confront the lions in their lairs.\\nThat is the nature of our ancestors: immensely courageous hunters,\\ndefenders, shepherds, voyagers, inventors, warriors, and founders of\\ncities and states. That is the father you could rescue; the ancestor you\\ncould become. And he is to be discovered in the deepest possible\\nplace, as that is where you must go if you wish to take full\\nresponsibility and become who you could be.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nLet us agree, to begin with, that you have a minimum moral\\nobligation to take care of yourself. Maybe you are just selfishly\\ninterested in taking care of yourself. But then the questions arise:\\nWhat do you mean by “care”? Which “yourself” are you talking\\nabout? We will just consider pure selfishness to begin with,\\nuncontaminated self-interest. That keeps it simple. That means, for\\nstarters, that you are free do anything you want—because you do not\\nhave to care about anyone else. But then something in you might well\\nobject: “Wait just a moment. That will not work.” Why not? Well,\\nwhich self are you taking care of? Are you taking care of the you that\\nspecifically exists this minute? What will happen, then, in the next?\\nBecause the future is coming, as certainly, for all intents and\\npurposes, as the sun rises in the morning. And you are best advised\\nto be ready for it.\\n\\n\\x0cYou know the risks if you choose to maximize now at the expense\\nof later. Imagine that you are about to utter something thoughtless\\nand angry. You think, “Take no prisoners,” and say whatever comes\\nto mind, no matter how unjust and cruel. You experience a release of\\npositive emotion and enthusiasm along with that, as well as the\\nsatisfying venting of resentment. Immediately thereafter, however,\\nyou are in trouble, and that trouble might stick around for a very\\nlong time. You have clearly not acted in your best interests, even\\nthough you did just what you selfishly wanted to. And no one with\\nany sense tells their beloved son or daughter, “Look, kid, just do\\nexactly what feels good in the moment, and to hell with everything\\nelse. It does not matter.” You do not say that, because you know full\\nwell that the future is coming for your child as surely as it comes for\\nyou. The mere fact that something makes you happy in the moment\\ndoes not mean that it is in your best interest, everything considered.\\nLife would be simple if that were the case. But there is the you now,\\nand the you tomorrow, and the you next week, and next year, and in\\nfive years, and in a decade—and you are required by harsh necessity\\nto take all of those “yous” into account. That is the curse associated\\nwith the human discovery of the future and, with it, the necessity of\\nwork—because to work means to sacrifice the hypothetical delights of\\nthe present for the potential improvement of what lies ahead.\\n\\nNow, there is some utility in discounting the importance of the\\n“yous” who exist far enough into the future, because the future is\\nuncertain. It is not the case that you should be as concerned about\\nthe effects of your current actions twenty years down the road as you\\nare now, because there is a very high probability that you are here\\nright now (if you are reading this) and somewhat less of a chance\\nthat you will be around then. And then there are the errors of\\nprediction you will make when looking so far ahead. But the\\nmounting uncertainty of distance in time does not stop sensible\\npeople from preparing for their later years. Here is what the future\\nmeans: If you are going to take care of yourself, you are already\\nburdened (or privileged) with a social responsibility. The you for\\nwhom you are caring is a community that exists across time. The\\nnecessity for considering this society of the individual, so to speak, is\\na burden and an opportunity that seems uniquely characteristic of\\nhuman beings.\\n\\n\\x0cAnimals do not seem to consider the future in the same manner as\\nwe do. If you visit the African veldt, and you observe a herd of zebras,\\nyou will often see lions lazing about around them. And as long as the\\nlions are lying around relaxing, the zebras really do not mind. This\\nattitude seems a little thoughtless, from the human perspective. The\\nzebras should instead be biding their time until the lions go to sleep.\\nThen they should run off to a corner of the field in a herd and\\nconspire a bit. And then several dozen of them should rush the\\nsleeping lions and stomp them to death. That would be the end of the\\nlion problem. But that is not what zebras do. They think, “Ah, look at\\nthose relaxed lions! Relaxed lions are never a problem!” Zebras do\\nnot seem to have any real sense of time. They cannot conceptualize\\nthemselves across the temporal expanse. But human beings not only\\nmanage such conceptualization, they cannot shake it. We discovered\\nthe future, some long time ago—and now the future is where we each\\nlive, in potential. We treat that as reality. It is a reality that only\\nmight be—but it is one with a high probability of becoming now,\\neventually, and we are driven to take that into account.\\n\\nYou are stuck with yourself. You are burdened with who you are\\nright now and who you are going to be in the future. That means that\\nif you are treating yourself properly, you must consider your\\nrepetition across time. You are destined to play a game with yourself\\ntoday that must not interfere with the game you play tomorrow, next\\nmonth, next year, and so on. Thus, narrow selfishness is destined to\\nbe nonproductive. It is for this reason, among others, that a strictly\\nindividualist ethic is a contradiction in terms. There is in fact little\\ndifference between how you should treat yourself—once you realize\\nthat you are a community that extends across time—and how you\\nshould treat other people.\\n\\nIn a marriage, for example, you face the same problem with your\\n\\nmarital partner as you do with yourself: You are stuck with the\\nconsequences of an iterating game. You can treat your husband or\\nwife any old way right now, this moment, no matter how horrid and\\nthoughtless that way might be, but you are going to wake up with\\nhim or her tomorrow, and next month, and a decade from now (and,\\nif not that person, then someone else equally unfortunate). If you\\ntreat the person you are committed to in a manner that does not\\nwork when it is repeated across time, then you are playing a\\ndegenerating game, and you are both going to suffer terribly for it.\\n\\n\\x0cThis problem is not materially different from failing to make peace\\nwith your future self. The consequences are identical.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nPeople want to be happy, and no wonder. I have longed deeply, many\\ntimes, for the return of happiness—hoping for its current presence—\\nand I am certainly not alone in that. However, I do not believe you\\nshould pursue happiness. If you do so, you will run right into the\\niteration problem, because “happy” is a right-now thing. If you place\\npeople in situations where they are feeling a lot of positive emotion,\\nthey get present-focused and impulsive.4 This means “make hay\\nwhile the sun shines”—take your opportunities while things are good\\nand act now. But now is by no means everything, and unfortunately,\\neverything must be considered, at least insofar as you are able. In\\nconsequence, it is unlikely that whatever optimizes your life across\\ntime is happiness. I am not denying its desirability, by the way. If\\nhappiness comes to you, welcome it with gratitude and open arms\\n(but be careful, because it does make you impetuous).\\n\\nWhat might serve as a more sophisticated alternative to\\nhappiness? Imagine it is living in accordance with the sense of\\nresponsibility, because that sets things right in the future. Imagine,\\nas well, that you must act reliably, honestly, nobly, and in\\nrelationship to a higher good, in order to manifest the sense of\\nresponsibility properly. The higher good would be the simultaneous\\noptimization of your function and the function of the people around\\nyou, across time, as we have discussed previously. That is the highest\\ngood. Imagine that you make that aim conscious, that you articulate\\nthat aim as an explicit goal. Then a question arises: “What is the\\nconsequence of that psychologically?”\\n\\nFirst, consider that most of the positive emotion people experience\\n\\ndoes not come from attaining something. There is the simple\\npleasure (more accurately, the satisfaction) that comes from having a\\ngood meal when hungry, and there is the more complex but similar\\nsatisfaction that is associated with accomplishing something difficult\\nand worthwhile. Imagine, for example, that you graduate from grade\\n12. Graduation Day marks the event. It is a celebration. But the next\\nday that is over, and you immediately face a new set of problems\\n\\n\\x0c(just as you are hungry again only a few hours after a satisfying\\nmeal). You are no longer king of the high school: you are bottom dog\\nin the work force, or a freshman at a postsecondary institution. You\\nare in the position of Sisyphus. You strove and struggled to push\\nyour boulder to the pinnacle, and you find yourself, instead, at the\\nfoot of the mountain.\\n\\nThere is a near-instantaneous transformation that comes as a\\nconsequence of attainment. Like impulsive pleasure, attainment will\\nproduce positive emotion. But, also like pleasure, attainment is\\nunreliable. Another question thus emerges: “What is a truly reliable\\nsource of positive emotion?” The answer is that people experience\\npositive emotion in relationship to the pursuit of a valuable goal.\\nImagine you have a goal. You aim at something. You develop a\\nstrategy in relationship to that aim, and then you implement it. And\\nthen, as you implement the strategy, you observe that it is working.\\nThat is what produces the most reliable positive emotion.5 Imagine\\nover time that the attitudes and actions that manage this most\\neffectively (in a competition that is very Darwinian) come,\\neventually, to dominate over all others.6 Imagine that is true\\npsychologically and socially, simultaneously. Imagine that this\\noccurs in your own life, but also across the centuries, as everyone\\ninteracts and talks and raises a particular mode of being to primary\\nstatus.\\n\\nThis implies something crucial: no happiness in the absence of\\nresponsibility. No valuable and valued goal, no positive emotion. You\\nmight object, “Well, what exactly constitutes a valid goal?” Imagine\\nthat you are pursuing something pleasurable, but short term and\\ntrivial. The wise part of you will be comparing that pursuit to the\\npossible goal of acting in the best interest of your community of\\nfuture selves and your community of other people. Perhaps you are\\nunwilling to allow yourself to realize that wisdom: You do not wish to\\nbear the responsibility—not in place of an immediate, impulsive\\nfocus on pleasure. You are fooling yourself, however, especially at the\\ndeeper levels of your being, if you believe such avoidance will prove\\nsuccessful. The wise and ancient parts of you, seriously concerned\\nwith your survival, are neither easy to deceive nor to set aside. But\\nyou take aim at a trivial goal anyway, and develop a rather shallow\\nstrategy to attain it, only to find it is not satisfying because you do\\nnot care enough. It does not matter to you—not deeply. Furthermore,\\n\\n\\x0cthe fact that you are not pursuing the goal you should rightly be\\npursuing means that you are feeling guilty, ashamed, and lesser at\\nthe same time.\\n\\nThis is not a helpful strategy. It is not going to work. I have never\\nmet anyone who was satisfied when they knew they were not doing\\neverything they should be doing. We are temporally aware creatures:\\nWe know that we are continually and inescapably playing an iterated\\ngame from which we cannot easily hide. No matter how much we\\nwish to discount the future completely, it is part of the price we paid\\nfor being acutely self-conscious and able to conceptualize ourselves\\nacross the entire span of our lives. We are stuck with it. There is no\\nescaping from the future—and when you are stuck with something\\nand there is no escaping from it, the right attitude is to turn around\\nvoluntarily and confront it. That works. And so, instead of your\\nshort-term impulsive goal, you lay out a much larger-scale goal,\\nwhich is to act properly in relationship to the long term for everyone.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThere is a proper way to behave—an ethic—and you are destined to\\ncontend with it. You cannot help but calculate yourself across time,\\nand everyone else across time, and you are reporting back to\\nyourself, inevitably, on your own behavior and misbehavior. What\\nworks across multiple time frames and multiple places for multiple\\npeople (including yourself)—that is the goal. It is an emergent ethic,\\nhard to formulate explicitly, but inescapable in its existence and its\\nconsequences, and an ineradicably deep part of the game of Being.\\nGreat players are attractive. Attractive people attract mates. The\\ncloser we match the pattern—the emergent pattern—the more likely\\nwe are to survive and protect our families. The playing field selects\\nthe players on the basis of their ethical behavior. And we are\\ntherefore biologically prepared to respond positively to and to\\nimitate the Great Player—and to disapprove, even violently, of the\\ndeceiver, the cheat, and the fraud. And it is your conscience—your\\ninstinct for moral virtue—that indicates deviation from the path.\\nWhen your child purposefully trips an opponent during a soccer\\ngame, or fails to pass to an open teammate with a great opportunity\\nto score, you frown. You feel shame, as you should, because you are\\n\\n\\x0cwitnessing the betrayal of someone you love, by someone you love—\\nand that is your child’s self-betrayal. Something similar occurs when\\nyou violate your own sense of propriety. It is the same instinct, and it\\nis best attended to. If you do not follow the right path, you will\\nwander off a cliff and suffer miserably—and there is simply no way\\nthat the most profound parts of yourself are going to allow that\\nwithout protest.\\n\\nYou might rationalize: “There is no cliff here now. There is no cliff\\n\\nI can see nearby. And a cliff I will not tumble off for ten years is a\\nlong way away.” But the part of your psyche that is most profound\\ninvariably objects: “Such thinking is not appropriate. It will not do.\\nWhat is ten years away is still real, despite its distance (allowing for\\nunavoidable errors of prediction). If there is a catastrophe waiting\\nthere, we are not going to aim at it now. Not without objection.” If\\nyour behavior suggests that you are tilting in that direction, then you\\nare going to feel guilty and horrible about it, if you are lucky and even\\nminimally awake. And thank God for that. If the cost of betraying\\nyourself, in the deepest sense, is guilt, shame, and anxiety, the\\nbenefit of not betraying yourself is meaning—the meaning that\\nsustains. That is the most valuable of opportunities that lurks where\\nresponsibility has been abdicated.\\n\\nIf you attend to your conscience, you will begin to determine that\\n\\nsome of the things you are doing are wrong. More precisely: if you\\nare alerted to the possibility of your own wrongdoing by your\\nconscience, and you then begin to engage in a true dialogue with that\\nsame agent, you will begin to develop a clear picture of what is wrong\\n—and, by implication, of what is right. Right is not least the opposite\\nof wrong—and wrong is in some clear sense more blatant and\\nobvious. A sense of right can therefore be developed and honed\\nthrough careful attention to what is wrong. You act and betray\\nyourself, and you feel bad about that. You do not know exactly why.\\nYou try to avoid thinking about it, because it is less painful and easier\\nin the short term not to think about it. You try with all your might to\\nignore it, but all that does is increase your sense of self-betrayal and\\nfurther divide you against yourself.\\n\\nSo, you reconsider, perhaps, and you confront your discomfort.\\n\\nYou note your disunity and the chaos that comes with it. You ask\\nyourself—you pray to discover—what you did wrong. And the answer\\narrives. And it is not what you want. And part of you must therefore\\n\\n\\x0cdie, so that you can change. And the part that must die struggles for\\nits existence, puts forward its rationale, and pleads its case. And it\\nwill do so with every trick in its possession—employing the most\\negregious lies, the bitterest, most resentment-eliciting memories of\\nthe past, and the most hopelessly cynical attitudes about the future\\n(indeed, about the value of life itself). But you persevere, and\\ndiscriminate, judge, and decide exactly why what you did was wrong,\\nand you start to understand, by contrast, what might have been right.\\nAnd then you determine to start acting in accordance with your\\nconscience. You decide that it is a partner, despite its adversarial\\nform. You put all that you have discovered to be right into action,\\nand you begin your ascent. You start to monitor yourself, ever more\\ncareful to ensure you are doing the right thing—listening to what you\\nsay, watching yourself act, trying not to deviate from the straight and\\nnarrow path. That becomes your goal.\\n\\nAn idea begins to take shape: “I am going to live my life properly. I\\n\\nam going to aim at the good. I am going to aim at the highest good I\\ncan possible manage.” Now, all the parts of you taking care of your\\nfuture self are on board. You are all aimed in one direction. You are\\nno longer a house divided against itself. You are standing solidly on a\\nfirm foundation. You are no longer so easy to dissuade or discourage.\\nYour resolution trumps your nihilism and despair. The struggle you\\nhave had with your own tendency to doubt and dissimulate protects\\nyou against the unwarranted and cynical criticisms of others. There\\nis a high goal, a mountain peak, a star that shines in the darkness,\\nbeckoning above the horizon. Its mere existence gives you hope—and\\nthat is the meaning without which you cannot live.\\n\\nRemember Pinocchio? When Geppetto wants to transform the\\nwooden-headed puppet he created into something real, he first raises\\nhis eyes above the horizon and wishes on a star. It is the same star\\nthat announces Pinocchio’s birth at the beginning of the movie and\\nwhose light is reflected in the golden badge granted to Jiminy Cricket\\nat the close. It is the same star, symbolically speaking, that\\nannounces the birth of Christ in the depths of the darkness. Geppetto\\nfocuses on the star and makes a wish. The wish is that his marionette\\nwith strings controlled by someone or something else will become\\nreal. The story of the puppet and his temptations and trials is a\\npsychological drama. We all understand it, even though we cannot\\nnecessarily articulate that understanding. It is necessary to lift your\\n\\n\\x0ceyes above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish\\nto cease being a puppet, under the control of things you do not\\nunderstand and perhaps do not want to understand. Then all the\\nsubsystems or subpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing their\\nown limited fulfillment will join together under the aegis of the truly\\nideal, and the consequence of that will be an engagement that\\napproximates the ultimate or total. Under such conditions, all the\\nparts of you are going to be on board. That is the psychological\\nequivalent of monotheism. That is the emergence of the higher self\\nthat might be the true servant of God, in whatever metaphysical\\nreality potentially underlies what is obvious to our blind and limited\\nmortal selves.\\n\\nWhat is the antidote to the suffering and malevolence of life? The\\n\\nhighest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the\\nhighest possible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of\\nresponsibility—and this includes the responsibilities that others\\ndisregard or neglect. You might object: “Why should I shoulder all\\nthat burden? It is nothing but sacrifice, hardship, and trouble.” But\\nwhat makes you so sure you do not want something heavy to carry?\\nYou positively need to be occupied with something weighty, deep,\\nprofound, and difficult. Then, when you wake up in the middle of the\\nnight and the doubts crowd in, you have some defense: “For all my\\nflaws, which are manifold, at least I am doing this. At least I am\\ntaking care of myself. At least I am of use to my family, and to the\\nother people around me. At least I am moving, stumbling upward,\\nunder the load I have determined to carry.” You can attain some\\ngenuine self-respect that way—but it is not a mere shallow\\npsychological construct that has to do with how you are construing\\nyourself in the moment. It is far deeper than that—and it is not only\\npsychological. It is real, as well as psychological.\\n\\nYour life becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depths\\nof the responsibility you are willing to shoulder. That is because you\\nare now genuinely involved in making things better. You are\\nminimizing the unnecessary suffering. You are encouraging those\\naround you, by example and word. You are constraining the\\nmalevolence in your own heart and the hearts of others. A bricklayer\\nmay question the utility of laying his bricks, monotonously, one after\\nanother. But perhaps he is not merely laying bricks. Maybe he is\\nbuilding a wall. And the wall is part of a building. And the building is\\n\\n\\x0ca cathedral. And the purpose of the cathedral is the glorification of\\nthe Highest Good. And under such circumstances, every brick laid is\\nan act that partakes of the divine. And if what you are doing in your\\nday-to-day activity is not enough, then you are not aiming at the\\nconstruction of a proper cathedral. And that is because you are not\\naiming high enough. Because if you were, then you would experience\\nthe sense of meaning in relationship to your sufficiently high goal,\\nand it would justify the misery and limitations of your life. If you\\nhave something meaningful to pursue, then you are engrossed in life.\\nYou are on a meaningful path. The most profound and reliable\\ninstinct for meaning—if not perverted by self-deceit and sin (there is\\nno other way to state it)—manifests itself when you are on the path of\\nmaximum virtue.\\n\\nThe sense of meaning is an indicator that you are on that path. It\\nis an indication that all the complexity that composes you is lined up\\nwithin you, and aimed at something worth pursuing—something that\\nbalances the world, something that produces harmony. It is\\nsomething you hear made manifest in music, and the profound sense\\nof meaning that music intrinsically produces. Maybe you are a\\nnihilistic death-metal punk. You are deeply skeptical and pessimistic.\\nYou find meaning nowhere. You hate everything, just on principle.\\nBut then your favorite nihilistic death-metal punk band lead guitarist\\nand his bandmates start to blast out their patterned harmonies—\\neach in alignment with the other—and you are caught! “Ah, I do not\\nbelieve in anything—but, God, that music!” And the lyrics are\\ndestructive and nihilistic and cynical and bitter and hopeless but it\\ndoes not matter, because the music beckons and calls to your spirit,\\nand fills it with the intimation of meaning, and moves you, so that\\nyou align yourself with the patterns, and you nod your head and tap\\nyour feet to the beat, participating despite yourself. It is those\\npatterns of sound, layered one on top of another, harmoniously,\\nmoving in the same direction, predictably and unpredictably, in\\nperfect balance: order and chaos, in their eternal dance. And you\\ndance with it, no matter how scornful you are. You align yourself\\nwith that patterned, directional harmony. And in that you find the\\nmeaning that sustains.\\n\\nYou are possessed of an instinct—a spirit—that orients you toward\\n\\nthe highest good. It calls your soul away from hell and toward\\nheaven. And because it is there, you find yourself frequently\\n\\n\\x0cdisillusioned. People disappoint you. You betray yourself; you lose a\\nmeaningful connection to your workplace, boss, or partner. You\\nthink, “The world is not set right. It is deeply troubling to me.” That\\nvery disenchantment, however, can serve as the indicator of destiny.\\nIt speaks of abdicated responsibility—of things left undone, of things\\nthat still need to be done. You are irritated about that need. You are\\nannoyed with the government, you are embittered and resentful\\nabout your job, you are unhappy with your parents, and you are\\nfrustrated with all these people around you who will not take on\\nresponsibility. There are, after all, things that are crying out to be\\naccomplished. You are outraged that what needs to be done is not\\nbeing done. That anger—that outrage—is, however, a doorway. That\\nobservation of abdicated responsibility is the indication of destiny\\nand meaning. The part of you that is oriented toward the highest\\ngood is pointing out the disjunction between the ideal you can\\nimagine—the ideal that is possessing you—and the reality you are\\nexperiencing. There is a gap there, and it is communicating its need\\nto be filled. You can give way to fury, in consequence, and blame it on\\nsomeone else—and it is not as if other people are not contributing to\\nthe problems. Or you can come to understand that your very\\ndisappointment is an indication to you from the most fundamental\\nlevels of your being that there is something wrong that needs to be\\nset right—and, perhaps, by you. What is it, that concern, that care,\\nthat irritation, that distraction? It is not the call to happiness. It is\\nthe call to the action and adventure that make up a real life.\\nConsider, once again, the biblical story of Abraham. God comes to\\nAbraham, and says,\\n\\nGo from your country, your people and your father’s\\nhousehold to the land I will show you.\\n\\nI will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I\\n\\nwill make your name great, and you will be a blessing.\\n\\nI will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you\\n\\nI will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed\\nthrough you. (Genesis 12:1–3)\\n\\nThat late bloomer Abraham has been hanging around his father’s\\ntent for far too many years, to put it mildly. But if God’s call comes, it\\n\\n\\x0cis better to heed it, no matter how late (and in that, there is real\\nhope, for those who believe that they have delayed too long).\\nAbraham leaves his country, and his people, and his father’s\\nhousehold, and journeys out into the world, following the still small\\nvoice; following God’s call. And it is no call to happiness. It is the\\ncomplete bloody catastrophe we previously described: famine, war,\\nand domestic strife. All this might make the reasonable individual\\n(not to mention Abraham himself) doubt the wisdom of listening to\\nGod and conscience, and of adopting the responsibility of autonomy\\nand the burden of adventure. Better to be lying in a hammock,\\ndevouring peeled grapes in the security of Dad’s tent. What calls you\\nout into the world, however—to your destiny—is not ease. It is\\nstruggle and strife. It is bitter contention and the deadly play of the\\nopposites. It is probable—inevitable—that the adventure of your life\\nwill frustrate and disappoint and unsettle you, as you heed the call of\\nconscience and shoulder your responsibility and endeavor to set\\nyourself and the world right. But that is where the deep meaning that\\norients you and shelters you is to be found. That is where things will\\nline up for you; where things that have been scattered apart and\\nbroken will come together; where purpose will manifest itself; where\\nwhat is proper and good will be supported and what is weak and\\nresentful and arrogant and destructive will be defeated. That is\\nwhere the life that is worth living is to be eternally found—and where\\nyou can find it, personally, if only you are willing.\\n\\nNotice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been\\n\\nabdicated.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\n\\nDO NOT DO WHAT YOU HATE\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00-\\x00\\x00-\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI once had a client who was subject to a barrage of constant idiocy as\\npart of her work in a giant corporation. She was a sensible, honest\\nperson who had withstood and managed a difficult life and who\\ngenuinely wished to contribute and work in a manner commensurate\\nwith her good sense and honesty. She became subject while\\nemployed in the corporate environment to a long, in-person and\\nemail-mediated dispute about whether the term “flip chart” (a\\ncommon phrase, referring to a large pad of paper sheets, typically\\nsupported by a tripod) was in fact a term of abuse. For those of you\\nwho still find it difficult to believe that conversations such as this\\noccupy the hours of corporate workers, try a quick Google search.\\n“Flip chart derogatory” will suffice. You will see immediately that\\nconcern about this issue genuinely and rather widely exists. Many\\nmeetings were held by her superiors at work to discuss this issue.\\n\\n“Flip” was apparently at one time a derogatory term for Filipino (I\\n\\ncould find little evidence for its use now). Even though the former\\nslur has nothing whatsoever to do with “flip chart,” the\\nadministrators of her firm felt that their time was well spent\\ndiscussing the hypothetically prejudicial nature of the phrase and\\nformulating a replacement term, the use of which eventually became\\nmandatory among employees. This was all despite the fact that no\\nemployee of Filipino nationality or descent had ever complained\\nabout the corporation’s use of the term. According to the Global\\nLanguage Monitor (languagemonitor.com), which monitors but does\\nnot approve politically correct word usage, the proper term is now\\n\\n\\x0c“writing block,” despite the fact that a flip chart is in no way a\\n“block.”\\n\\nIn any case, the corporation in question settled on “easel pad,”\\nwhich seems somewhat more descriptively accurate—not that this\\ncomparatively elegant solution detracts from the foolishness in\\nquestion. After all, we are still left with “flip-flopped,” “flippant,”\\n“flip-flops,” “flippers,” and so on, and at least the first two of those\\nsound more derogatory on first exposure than “flip chart,” if we are\\ngoing to concern ourselves with such things. Now, you might\\nwonder: “What difference does this minor change in terminology\\nreally make? It is a trivial problem. Why would someone become\\nconcerned about the fact that such change is being discussed? Why\\nnot ignore it, as it is best to ignore so much folly, and concentrate on\\nsomething of more importance?” Because, of course, you could claim\\nthat paying attention to someone attending to such issues is as much\\na waste of time as attending to the discussion in the first place. And I\\nwould say that is precisely the conundrum Rule V is trying to\\naddress. When do you stop participating in a worrisome process that\\nyou see, or think you see, unfolding in front of you?\\n\\nMy client first wrote me about the fact that not only was the string\\n\\nof communication discussing the use of “flip chart” well received by\\nher coworkers, but that a contest of sorts immediately emerged to\\nidentify and communicate additional words that might also be\\noffensive.* “Blackboard” was mentioned, as was “master key” (the\\nformer perhaps because referring to anything as “black”—even if it is\\nblack—is somehow racist in our hypersensitive times; the latter\\nbecause of its hypothetical relationship to terminology historically\\nassociated with slavery). My client tried to make sense of what she\\nwas witnessing: “Such discussions give people the superficial sense of\\nbeing good, noble, compassionate, openhearted, and wise. So, if for\\nthe sake of argument anyone disagrees, how could that person join\\nthe discussion without being considered anticompassionate, narrow\\nminded, racist and wicked?”\\n\\nShe was also perturbed because no one at her workplace was\\napparently bothered that any given group of people might endow\\nthemselves with the authority to ban words (and to disdain or even\\ndiscipline those who continued to use them) without perceiving any\\nethical overreach on their part, and without perceiving the danger of\\nsuch censorship, which could easily extend, say, to personal\\n\\n\\x0copinions, topics of conversation—or, for that matter, books. Finally,\\nshe believed that the entire discussion constituted a prime example\\nof “diversity,” “inclusivity,” and “equity”—terms that had become\\nveritable mantras for the departments of Human Resources or\\nLearning and Development (the latter of which she worked for). She\\nregarded them as “engines of corporate indoctrination and\\nideological propaganda” and as part of the manner in which the\\npolitical correctness that characterizes, above all, many university\\nprograms extends its reach into the broader culture. More\\nimportantly, however, she asked me in one of her letters, “Is this a\\ncase where enough is enough?” When and where do we stop? If a tiny\\nminority of people even hypothetically finds some words offensive,\\nthen what? Do we continue to ban words endlessly?”\\n\\nWhat my client was perceiving—at least as far as she was\\n\\nconcerned—was not a single event, hypothetically capable of heading\\nthose involved in it down a dangerous path, but a clearly identifiable\\nand causally related variety or sequence of events, all heading in the\\nsame direction. Those events seemed to form a coherent pattern,\\nassociated with an ideology that was directional in its intent,\\nexplicitly and implicitly. Furthermore, the effect of that directionality\\nhad been manifesting itself, by all appearances, for a reasonable\\namount of time, not only in the corporate world my client inhabited,\\nbut in the broader world of social and political institutions\\nsurrounding the corporation for which she worked. Although rather\\nisolated in the department she happened to work in (the very\\nepicenter of the ideological blitz of the corporation in question), she\\ncould see around her evidence that the processes disturbing her were\\nalso having a detrimental effect on other people. And then there was\\nthe effect on her conscience. It is important to understand that these\\nissues were not minor philosophical concepts to her. They were\\nbothering her deeply and upsetting her life.\\n\\nIt is, of course, the case that being required to do stupid, hateful\\n\\nthings is demoralizing. Someone assigned a pointless or even\\ncounterproductive task will deflate, if they have any sense, and find\\nwithin themselves very little motivation to carry out the assignment.\\nWhy? Because every fiber of their genuine being fights against that\\nnecessity. We do the things we do because we think those things\\nimportant, compared to all the other things that could be important.\\nWe regard what we value as worthy of sacrifice and pursuit. That\\n\\n\\x0cworthiness motivates us to act, despite the fact that action is difficult\\nand dangerous. When we are called upon to do things that we find\\nhateful and stupid, we are simultaneously forced to act contrary to\\nthe structure of values motivating us to move forward stalwartly and\\nprotecting us from dissolution into confusion and terror. “To thine\\nown self be true,”1 as Polonius has it, in Shakespeare’s Hamlet. That\\n“self”—that integrated psyche—is in truth the ark that shelters us\\nwhen the storms gather and the water rises. To act in violation of its\\nprecepts—its fundamental beliefs—is to run our own ship onto the\\nshoals of destruction. To act in violation of the precepts of that\\nfundamental self is to cheat in the game we play with ourselves, to\\nsuffer the emptiness of betrayal, and to perceive abstractly and then\\nexperience in embodied form the loss that is inevitably to come.\\nWhat price did my client pay for her initial subjugation to the\\narbitrary dictates of her managers? She was an immigrant from a\\nformer Soviet bloc country and had experienced more than a\\nsufficient taste of authoritarian ideology. In consequence, her\\ninability to determine how she might object to what was happening\\nleft her feeling both weak and complicit. Furthermore, no sensible\\nperson could possibly remain motivated to put forth effort anywhere\\nsuch as her workplace had become, where absurdities of a conceptual\\nsort were not only continually occurring but encouraged or, even\\nworse, required. Such “action” makes a mockery of productive work\\nitself—even the very idea of productive work (and that is in fact part\\nof the true motivation for such behavior: those jealous of genuine\\ncompetence and productivity have every reason to undermine and\\ndenigrate even the concept of both). So, what did she do about the\\ndemoralizing state in which she found herself?\\n\\nMy client did not feel sufficiently confident in her position or in\\nthe ability of her managers to engage in a genuine conversation with\\nthem about her objections, although it was clear from my\\nconversations with her that she wished very much to escape from the\\nsituation. In consequence, she began to develop what might be\\nconsidered a rearguard action. She was already involved in\\ndeveloping in-house education projects for the company, as we\\nmentioned. It was possible for her, therefore, to begin to branch out,\\noffering her services as a speaker at a variety of corporate\\nconferences. Although she never directly confronted the flip chart\\nissue (and may have been wise to avoid doing so), she began to speak\\n\\n\\x0cout against the kind of pseudoscience that characterizes many of the\\nideas that corporate managers, particularly in Human Resources\\ndepartments, regard as valid. She presented a number of talks, for\\nexample, criticizing the widespread fad of “learning styles”—a theory\\npredicated on the idea that there are between four and eight different\\nmodalities that individuals prefer and that aid them if used when\\nthey are trying to master new ideas. These include, for example,\\nvisual, auditory, verbal, physical, and logical, among others.\\n\\nThe problem with the learning styles theory? Most basically: there\\n\\nis simply no evidence whatsoever for its validity. First, although\\nstudents may express a preference for information being delivered in\\none form over another, practically delivering it in that form does not\\nimprove their academic performance.2 Second (and this makes\\nsense, given the first problem), there is no evidence that teachers can\\naccurately assess the “learning style” of their students.3 So, although\\nit was not possible for my client to directly confront the particular\\nfoolishness that was disturbing her, after long strategizing and much\\nwork she did manage to push back very effectively against the\\nignorance that characterized what passed for psychological\\nknowledge among a substantial subset of her coworkers (as well as\\nthose who worked in other companies, where the same things were\\ntaking place). She had also done some work as a journalist for one of\\nthe major newspapers in Albania, her country of origin, and began to\\nmake continuing to do so a higher priority. This did not pay well, but\\nshe developed a stellar professional reputation there, and fought\\nhard in print for what she believed in, warning the citizens of her\\nonce-Communist-dominated state of the move toward totalitarian\\nopinion beginning to make itself attractive to people in the West.\\n\\nWhat price did she pay for her decision to stand up and fight? To\\nbegin with, she had to face her fear of reprisal, as well as the fact that\\nsuch fear—in combination with the profound distaste she felt for the\\nideological maneuvers characterizing her workplace—was destroying\\nher interest in her office profession, as well as making her feel\\ninadequate and cowardly. Then, she had to broaden her professional\\nactivities: first, taking the risk of offering herself as a speaker at\\ncorporate conventions (and people are generally very loath to talk\\npublicly—it is a common fear, often severe enough to interfere with\\ncareer progression4); second, mastering the literature, enabling her\\nto speak in a credible and informed manner; and third, presenting\\n\\n\\x0cmaterial that, given its critical nature, was bound to offend a\\nreasonable proportion of those in the audience (precisely those who\\nhad accepted and who were propagating the theories that she was\\nnow discrediting). This all meant the facing of her fear—of inaction,\\nas well as action. These moves challenged her deeply—but the\\nconsequence was an expansion of personality and competence, as\\nwell as the knowledge that she was making a genuine social\\ncontribution.\\n\\nI believe that the good that people do, small though it may appear,\\n\\nhas more to do with the good that manifests broadly in the world\\nthan people think, and I believe the same about evil. We are each\\nmore responsible for the state of the world than we believe, or would\\nfeel comfortable believing. Without careful attention, culture itself\\ntilts toward corruption. Tyranny grows slowly, and asks us to retreat\\nin comparatively tiny steps. But each retreat increases the possibility\\nof the next retreat. Each betrayal of conscience, each act of silence\\n(despite the resentment we feel when silenced), and each\\nrationalization weakens resistance and increases the probability of\\nthe next restrictive move forward. This is particularly the case when\\nthose pushing forward delight in the power they have now acquired—\\nand such people are always to be found. Better to stand forward,\\nawake, when the costs are relatively low—and, perhaps, when the\\npotential rewards have not yet vanished. Better to stand forward\\nbefore the ability to do so has been irretrievably compromised.\\nUnfortunately, people often act in spite of their conscience—even if\\nthey know it—and hell tends to arrive step by step, one betrayal after\\nanother. And it should be remembered that it is rare for people to\\nstand up against what they know to be wrong even when the\\nconsequences for doing so are comparatively slight. And this is\\nsomething to deeply consider, if you are concerned with leading a\\nmoral and careful life: if you do not object when the transgressions\\nagainst your conscience are minor, why presume that you will not\\nwillfully participate when the transgressions get truly out of hand?\\nPart of moving Beyond Order is knowing when you have such a\\n\\nreason. Part of moving Beyond Order is understanding that your\\nconscience has a primary claim on your action, which supersedes\\nyour conventional social duty. If you decide to stand up and refuse a\\ncommand, if you do something of which others disapprove but you\\nfirmly believe to be correct, you must be in a position to trust\\n\\n\\x0cyourself. This means that you must have attempted to live an honest,\\nmeaningful, productive life (of precisely the sort that might\\ncharacterize someone else you would tend to trust). If you have acted\\nhonorably, so that you are a trustworthy person, it will be your\\ndecision to refuse to comply or to act in a manner contrary to public\\nexpectation that will help society itself maintain its footing. By doing\\nso you can be part of the force of truth that brings corruption and\\ntyranny to a halt. The sovereign individual, awake and attending to\\nhis or her conscience, is the force that prevents the group, as the\\nnecessary structure guiding normative social relations, from\\nbecoming blind and deadly.\\n\\nI do not want to end this section on a falsely optimistic note. I\\nknow from further correspondence with my client that she shifted\\nher employment from one large organization to another several\\ntimes in the years that followed. In one case, she found a good\\nposition, where it was possible to engage in productive, sensible,\\nmeaningful work. However, although successful there, she was laid\\noff during a corporate reorganization, and has since found the other\\ncompanies she has worked for as thoroughly possessed by the\\ncurrent linguistic and identity-politics fads as her original place of\\nemployment. Some dragons are everywhere, and they are not easy to\\ndefeat. But her attempts to fight back—her work debunking\\npseudoscientific theories; her work as a journalist—helped buttress\\nher against depression and bolster her self-regard.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nWhen culture disintegrates—because it refuses to be aware of its own\\npathology; because the visionary hero is absent—it descends into the\\nchaos that underlies everything. Under such conditions, the\\nindividual can dive voluntarily as deeply as he or she dares into the\\ndepths and rediscover the eternal principles renewing vision and life.\\nThe alternative is despair, corruption, and nihilism—thoughtless\\nsubjugation to the false words of totalitarian utopianism and life as a\\nmiserable, lying, and resentful slave.\\n\\nIf you wish instead to be engaged in a great enterprise—even if you\\nregard yourself as a mere cog—you are required not to do things you\\nhate. You must fortify your position, regardless of its meanness and\\n\\n\\x0clittleness, confront the organizational mendacity undermining your\\nspirit, face the chaos that ensues, rescue your near-dead father from\\nthe depths, and live a genuine and truthful life. Otherwise, nature\\nhides her face, society stultifies, and you remain a marionette, with\\nyour strings pulled by demonic forces operating behind the scenes—\\nand one more thing: it is your fault. No one is destined in the\\ndeterministic sense to remain a puppet.\\n\\nWe are not helpless. Even in the rubble of the most broken-down\\n\\nlives, useful weapons might still be found. Likewise, even the giant\\nmost formidable in appearance may not be as omnipotent as it\\nproclaims or appears. Allow for the possibility that you may be able\\nto fight back; that you may be able to resist and maintain your soul—\\nand perhaps even your job. (But a better job may also beckon if you\\ncan tolerate the idea of the transformation.) If you are willing to\\nconceptualize yourself as someone who could—and, perhaps more\\nimportantly, should—stand fast, you may begin to perceive the\\nweapons at your disposal. If what you are doing is causing you to lash\\nout at others impulsively; if what you are doing is destroying your\\nmotivation to move forward; if your actions and inactions are\\nmaking you contemptuous of yourself and, worse, of the world; if the\\nmanner in which you conduct your life is making it difficult for you\\nto wake happily in the morning; if you are plagued by a deep sense of\\nself-betrayal—perhaps you are choosing to ignore that still small\\nvoice, inclined as you may be to consider it something only attended\\nto by the weak and naive.\\n\\nIf you are at work, and called upon to do what makes you\\n\\ncontemptuous of yourself—weak and ashamed, likely to lash out at\\nthose you love, unwilling to perform productively, and sick of your\\nlife—it is possible that it is time to meditate, consider, strategize, and\\nplace yourself in a position where you are capable of saying no.*\\nPerhaps you will garner additional respect from the people you are\\nopposing on moral grounds, even though you may still pay a high\\nprice for your actions. Perhaps they will even come to rethink their\\nstance—if not now, with time (as their own consciences might be\\nplaguing them in that same still small manner).\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x0cPerhaps you should also be positioning yourself for a lateral move—\\ninto another job, for example, noting as you may, “This occupation is\\ndeadening my soul, and that is truly not for me. It is time to take the\\npainstaking steps necessary to organize my CV, and to engage in the\\ndifficult, demanding, and often unrewarding search for a new job”\\n(but you have to be successful only once). Maybe you can find\\nsomething that pays better and is more interesting, and where you\\nare working with people who not only fail to kill your spirit, but\\npositively rejuvenate it. Maybe following the dictates of conscience is\\nin fact the best possible plan that you have—at minimum, otherwise\\nyou have to live with your sense of self-betrayal and the knowledge\\nthat you put up with what you truly could not tolerate. Nothing about\\nthat is good.\\n\\nI might get fired. Well, prepare now to seek out and ready yourself\\nfor another job, hopefully better (or prepare yourself to go over your\\nmanager’s head with a well-prepared and articulate argument). And\\ndo not begin by presuming that leaving your job, even involuntarily,\\nis necessarily for the worst.\\n\\nI am afraid to move. Well, of course you are, but afraid compared\\n\\nto what? Afraid in comparison to continuing in a job where the\\ncenter of your being is at stake; where you become weaker, more\\ncontemptible, more bitter, and more prone to pressure and tyranny\\nover the years? There are few choices in life where there is no risk on\\neither side, and it is often necessary to contemplate the risks of\\nstaying as thoroughly as the risks of moving. I have seen many\\npeople move, sometimes after several years of strategizing, and end\\nup in better shape, psychologically and pragmatically, after their\\ntime in the desert.\\n\\nPerhaps no one else would want me. Well, the rejection rate for\\n\\nnew job applications is extraordinarily high. I tell my clients to\\nassume 50:1, so their expectations are set properly. You are going to\\nbe passed over, in many cases, for many positions for which you are\\nqualified. But that is rarely personal. It is, instead, a condition of\\nexistence, an inevitable consequence of somewhat arbitrary\\nsubjection to the ambivalent conditions of worth characterizing\\nsociety. It is the consequence of the fact that CVs are easy to\\ndisseminate and difficult to process; that many jobs have\\nunannounced internal candidates (and so are just going through the\\nmotions); and that some companies keep a rolling stock of\\n\\n\\x0capplicants, in case they need to hire quickly. That is an actuarial\\nproblem, a statistical problem, a baseline problem—and not\\nnecessarily an indication that there is something specifically flawed\\nabout you. You must incorporate all that sustainingly pessimistic\\nrealism into your expectations, so that you do not become\\nunreasonably downhearted. One hundred and fifty applications,\\ncarefully chosen; three to five interviews thereby acquired. That\\ncould be a mission of a year or more. That is much less than a\\nlifetime of misery and downward trajectory. But it is not nothing.\\nYou need to fortify yourself for it, plan, and garner support from\\npeople who understand what you are up to and are realistically\\nappraised of the difficulty and the options.\\n\\nNow it may also be that you are lagging in the development of your\\n\\nskills and could improve your performance at work so that your\\nchances of being hired elsewhere are heightened. But there is no loss\\nin that. You cannot effectively pronounce “no” in the presence of\\ncorrupt power when your options to move are nonexistent. In\\nconsequence, you have a moral obligation to place yourself in a\\nposition of comparative strength, and to do then what is necessary to\\ncapitalize on that strength. You may also have to think through\\nworst-case situations and to discuss them with those who will be\\naffected by your decisions. But it is once again worth realizing that\\nstaying where you should not be may be the true worst-case\\nsituation: one that drags you out and kills you slowly over decades.\\nThat is not a good death, even though it is slow, and there is very\\nlittle in it that does not speak of the hopelessness that makes people\\nage quickly and long for the cessation of career and, worse, life. That\\nis no improvement. As the old and cruel cliché goes: If you must cut\\noff a cat’s tail, do not do it half an inch at a time. You may well be in\\nfor a few painful years of belated recognition of insufficiency, and\\nrequired to send out four or five or ten job applications a week,\\nknowing full well that the majority will be rejected with less than a\\nsecond look. But you need to win the lottery only once, and a few\\nyears of difficulty with hope beat an entire dejected lifetime of a\\ndegenerating and oppressed career.\\n\\nAnd let us be clear: It is not a simple matter of hating your job\\nbecause it requires you to wake up too early in the morning, or to\\ndrag yourself to work when it is too hot or cold or windy or dry or\\nwhen you are feeling low and want to curl up in bed. It is not a\\n\\n\\x0cmatter of frustration generated when you are called on to do things\\nthat are menial or necessary such as emptying garbage cans,\\nsweeping floors, cleaning bathrooms, or in any other manner taking\\nyour lowly but well-deserved place at the bottom of the hierarchy of\\ncompetence—even of seniority. Resentment generated by such\\nnecessary work is most often merely ingratitude, inability to accept a\\nlowly place at the beginning, unwillingness to adopt the position of\\nthe fool, or arrogance and lack of discipline. Refusal of the call of\\nconscience is by no means the same thing as irritation about\\nundesirably low status.\\n\\nThat rejection—that betrayal of soul—is truly the requirement to\\nperform demonstrably counterproductive, absurd, or pointless work;\\nto treat others unjustly and to lie about it; to engage in deceit, to\\nbetray your future self; to put up with unnecessary torture and abuse\\n(and to silently watch others suffer the same treatment). That\\nrejection is the turning of a blind eye, and the agreement to say and\\ndo things that betray your deepest values and make you a cheat at\\nyour own game. And there is no doubt that the road to hell,\\npersonally and socially, is paved not so much with good intentions as\\nwith the adoption of attitudes and undertaking of actions that\\ninescapably disturb your conscience.\\n\\nDo not do what you hate.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nABANDON IDEOLOGY\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nAfter I published my last book, my wife, Tammy, and I embarked on\\na lengthy speaking tour throughout the English-speaking world and a\\ngood part of Europe, particularly in the north. Most of the theaters I\\nspoke at were old and beautiful, and it was a delight to be in\\nbuildings with such rich architectural and cultural histories, where so\\nmany of the bands we loved had played, and where other performing\\nartists had had their great moments. We booked 160 theaters—\\ngenerally with a capacity of about 2,500 to 3,000 people (although\\nthere were smaller venues in Europe, and larger in Australia). I was\\n—and am—struck to the core by the fact that there was such an\\nextensive audience for my lectures—and that we found that audience\\nseemingly everywhere. The same surprise extends to my YouTube\\nand podcast appearances—on my own channels, in interviews on\\nothers, and in the innumerable clips that people have voluntarily cut\\nfrom my longer talks and discussions with journalists. These have\\nbeen watched or listened to hundreds of millions of times. And\\nfinally, there is the aforementioned book, which will have sold\\nsomething like four million copies in English by the time the present\\nvolume is published, and which will be translated into fifty additional\\nlanguages, assuming matters continue as they are now. It is not at all\\neasy to know what to think about finding myself with an audience\\nlike that.\\n\\nWhat is going on? Any sensible person would be taken aback—to\\n\\nput it mildly—by all of this. It seems that my work must be\\naddressing something that is missing in many people’s lives. Now, as\\nI mentioned previously, I am relying for much of my content on the\\n\\n\\x0cideas of great psychologists and other thinkers, and that should\\ncount for something. But I have also been continually considering\\nwhat else more specific (if anything) might be attracting people’s\\nattention, and have been relying on two sources of information to try\\nto determine exactly that. The first is the response I get directly from\\nindividuals themselves, when I meet them in the immediate\\naftermath of one of my lectures or when they stop me on the street,\\nin airports, cafés, or other public places.\\n\\nIn one midwestern American city (I think it might have been\\nLouisville), a young man met me after my lecture and said, “Quick\\nstory. Two years ago, I was released from prison. Homeless. Broke. I\\nstarted listening to your lectures. Now I have a full-time job, and I\\nown my apartment, and my wife and I just had our first child—a\\ndaughter. Thank you.” And the “thank you” was accompanied with\\ndirect eye contact and a firm handshake, and the story was told in\\nthe voice of conviction. And people tell me very similar stories on the\\nstreet, often in tears, although the one I just related was perhaps a bit\\nmore extreme than the average tale. They share very private good\\nnews (the kind you share only with people to whom you can safely\\ntell such things). And I feel greatly privileged to be one of those\\npeople, although it is emotionally demanding to be the recipient of\\ncontinual personal revelations, regardless (or maybe even because)\\nof the fact that they are so positive. I find it heart-wrenching to see\\nhow little encouragement and guidance so many people have\\nreceived, and how much good can emerge when just a little more is\\nprovided. “I knew you could do it” is a good start, and goes a long\\nway toward ameliorating some of the unnecessary pain in the world.\\n\\nSo, that is one form of story that I hear, continually, in many\\nvariants. When we meet, one on one, people also tell me that they\\nenjoy my lectures and what I have written because what I say and\\nwrite provides them with the words they need to express things they\\nalready know, but are unable to articulate. It is helpful for everyone\\nto be able to represent explicitly what they already implicitly\\nunderstand. I am frequently plagued with doubts about the role that\\nI am playing, so the fact that people find my words exist in\\naccordance with their deep but heretofore unrealized or unexpressed\\nbeliefs is reassuring, helping me maintain faith in what I have\\nlearned and thought about and have now shared so publicly. Helping\\npeople bridge the gap between what they profoundly intuit but\\n\\n\\x0ccannot articulate seems to be a reasonable and valuable function for\\na public intellectual. And then there is the final piece of information\\nbearing on whatever it is that I am accomplishing. I have garnered it\\nas a direct consequence of the live lectures that I have had so many\\nopportunities to deliver. It is a privilege and a gift to be able to talk\\nrepeatedly to large groups of people. It provides a real-time\\nopportunity to judge the zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. It also\\nallows me to formulate and immediately test new ideas for their\\ncommunicability and their ability to grip attention and, thereby, to\\njudge their quality—at least in part. This occurs during the talk when\\nI attend to how the audience responds.\\n\\nIn 12 Rules for Life, Rule 9: Assume that the person you are\\nlistening to might know something you do not, I suggest that when\\nspeaking to a large group you should nonetheless always be\\nattending to specific individuals—the crowd is somewhat of an\\nillusion. However, you can augment your individual-focused visual\\nattention by simultaneously listening to the entire group, so that you\\nhear them rustling around, laughing, coughing, or whatever they\\nhappen to be doing, while you concentrate on perceiving specific\\nindividuals. What you want to see from the person you are facing is\\nrapt attention. What you want to hear from the crowd is dead silence.\\nYou want to hear nothing. Achieving that means your listeners are\\nnot distracted by everything they could be thinking about while in\\nattendance. If you are an audience member at a performance, and\\nyou are not completely enthralled by the content, you become\\npreoccupied by some slight physical discomforts, and shift from\\nplace to place. You become aware of your own thoughts. You begin to\\nthink about what you need to do tomorrow. You whisper something\\nto the person beside you. That all adds up to discontent in the\\naudience, and audible noise. But if you, as speaker, are positioned\\nproperly on stage, physically and spiritually, then everybody’s\\nattention will be focused with laser-like intensity on whatever you\\nare saying, and no one will make a sound. In this manner, you can\\ntell what ideas have power.\\n\\nWhile watching and listening in the way I just described to all the\\n\\ngatherings I have spoken to, I became increasingly aware that the\\nmention of one topic in particular brought every audience (and I\\nmean that without exception) to a dead-quiet halt: responsibility—\\nthe very topic we made central in this book in Rule IV: Notice that\\n\\n\\x0copportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated. That\\nresponse was fascinating—and not at all predictable. Responsibility\\nis not an easy sell. Parents have been striving forever to make their\\nkids responsible. Society attempts the same thing, with its\\neducational institutions, apprenticeships, volunteer organizations,\\nand clubs. You might even consider the inculcation of responsibility\\nthe fundamental purpose of society. But something has gone wrong.\\nWe have committed an error, or a series of errors. We have spent too\\nmuch time, for example (much of the last fifty years), clamoring\\nabout rights, and we are no longer asking enough of the young\\npeople we are socializing. We have been telling them for decades to\\ndemand what they are owed by society. We have been implying that\\nthe important meanings of their lives will be given to them because\\nof such demands, when we should have been doing the opposite:\\nletting them know that the meaning that sustains life in all its\\ntragedy and disappointment is to be found in shouldering a noble\\nburden. Because we have not been doing this, they have grown up\\nlooking in the wrong places. And this has left them vulnerable:\\nvulnerable to easy answers and susceptible to the deadening force of\\nresentment. What about the unfolding of history has left us in this\\nposition? How has this vulnerability, this susceptibility, come about?\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIn the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the German\\nphilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously announced “God is dead.”\\nThis utterance has become so famous that you can even see it\\nscribbled on the walls of public bathrooms, where it often takes the\\nfollowing form: “God is dead” —Nietzsche. “Nietzsche is dead” —\\nGod. Nietzsche did not make this claim in a narcissistic or\\ntriumphant manner. The great thinker’s opinion stemmed from his\\nfear that all the Judeo-Christian values serving as the foundation of\\nWestern civilization had been made dangerously subject to casual\\nrational criticism, and that the most important axiom upon which\\nthey were predicated—the existence of a transcendent, all-powerful\\ndeity—had been fatally challenged. Nietzsche concluded from this\\nthat everything would soon fall apart, in a manner catastrophic both\\npsychologically and socially.\\n\\n\\x0cIt does not require a particularly careful reader to note that\\nNietzsche described God, in The Gay Science, as the “holiest and\\nmightiest of all that the world has yet owned,” and modern human\\nbeings as “the murderers of all murderers.”1 These are not the sorts\\nof descriptions you might expect from a triumphant rationalist\\ncelebrating the demise of superstition. It was instead a statement of\\nabsolute despair. In his other works, particularly in The Will to\\nPower, Nietzsche describes what would occur in the next century\\nand beyond because of this murderous act.2 He prophesied (and that\\nis the correct word for it) that two major consequences would arise—\\napparent opposites, although each linked inextricably and causally\\ntogether—and both associated with the death of traditional ritual,\\nstory, and belief.\\n\\nAs the purpose of human life became uncertain outside the\\npurposeful structure of monotheistic thought and the meaningful\\nworld it proposed, we would experience an existentially devastating\\nrise in nihilism, Nietzsche believed. Alternatively, he suggested,\\npeople would turn to identification with rigid, totalitarian ideology:\\nthe substitute of human ideas for the transcendent Father of All\\nCreation. The doubt that undermines and the certainty that crushes:\\nNietzsche’s prognostication for the two alternatives that would arise\\nin the aftermath of the death of God.\\n\\nThe incomparable Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky addressed\\n\\nthe same question as Nietzsche—at about the same time—in his\\nmasterwork The Possessed (alternatively known as Demons or The\\nDevils).3 The protagonist in that novel, Nikolai Stavrogin, is wed to\\nthe same ideals that eventually birthed revolutionary communism,\\nalthough he lives his fictional life decades before the full-fledged\\nturmoil began in what became the Soviet Union. The appearance of\\nthese ideals was not a positive development, in Dostoevsky’s view.\\nHe could see that the adoption of a rigid, comprehensive utopian\\nideology, predicated on a few apparently self-evident axioms,\\npresented a political and spiritual danger with the potential to far\\nexceed in brutality all that had occurred in the religious,\\nmonarchical, or even pagan past. Dostoyevsky, like Nietzsche,\\nforesaw that all of this was coming almost fifty years (!) before the\\nLeninist Revolution in Russia. That incomprehensible level of\\nprophetic capacity remains a stellar example of how the artist and his\\nintuition brings to light the future far before others see it.\\n\\n\\x0cNietzsche and Dostoevsky both foresaw that communism would\\nappear dreadfully attractive—an apparently rational, coherent, and\\nmoral alternative to religion or nihilism—and that the consequences\\nwould be lethal. The former wrote, in his inimitably harsh, ironic,\\nand brilliant manner, “In fact, I even wish a few experiments might\\nbe made to show that in socialistic society life denies itself, and itself\\ncuts away its own roots. The earth is big enough and man is still\\nunexhausted enough for a practical lesson of this sort and\\ndemonstratio ad absurdum—even if it were accomplished only by a\\nvast expenditure of lives—to seem worthwhile to me.”4 The socialism\\nNietzsche referred to was not the relatively mild version later\\npopular in Britain, Scandinavia, and Canada, with its sometimes\\ngenuine emphasis on the improvement of working-class life, but the\\nfull-blown collectivism of Russia, China, and a host of smaller\\ncountries. Whether we have truly learned the “practical lesson”—the\\ndemonstration of the absurdity of the doctrine—as a consequence of\\nNietzsche’s predicted “vast expenditure of lives” remains to be seen.\\nNietzsche appears to have unquestioningly adopted the idea that\\nthe world was both objective and valueless in the manner posited by\\nthe emergent physical sciences. This left him with a single remaining\\nescape from nihilism and totalitarianism: the emergence of the\\nindividual strong enough to create his own values, project them onto\\nvalueless reality, and then abide by them. He posited that a new kind\\nof man—the Übermensch (the higher person or superman)—would\\nbe necessary in the aftermath of the death of God, so that society\\nwould not drift toward the opposing rocky shoals of despair and\\noversystematized political theorizing. Individuals who take this\\nroute, this alternative to nihilism and totalitarianism, must therefore\\nproduce their own cosmology of values.\\n\\nHowever, the psychoanalysts Freud and Jung put paid to that\\nnotion, demonstrating that we are not sufficiently in possession of\\nourselves to create values by conscious choice. Furthermore, there is\\nlittle evidence that any of us have the genius to create ourselves ex\\nnihilo—from nothing—particularly given the extreme limitations of\\nour experience, the biases of our perceptions, and the short span of\\nour lives. We have a nature—or, too often, it has us—and only a fool\\nwould now dare to claim that we have sufficient mastery of ourselves\\nto create, rather than discover, what we value. We have the capacity\\nfor spontaneous revelatory experience—artistic, inventive, and\\n\\n\\x0creligious. We discover new things about ourselves constantly, to our\\ndelight—and also to our dismay, as we are so often overcome by our\\nemotions and motivations. We contend with our nature. We\\nnegotiate with it. But it is not at all obvious that the individual will\\never be capable of bringing the new values that Nietzsche so fervently\\nlonged for into being.\\n\\nThere are other problems with Nietzsche’s argument, as well. If\\n\\neach of us lives by our own created and projected values, what\\nremains to unite us? This is a philosophical problem of central\\nimportance. How could a society of Übermenschen possibly avoid\\nbeing at constant odds with one another, unless there was something\\ncomparable about their created values? Finally, it is by no means\\nobvious that any such supermen have ever come into existence.\\nInstead, over the last century and a half, with the modern crisis of\\nmeaning and the rise of totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany, the\\nUSSR, and Communist China, we appear to have found ourselves in\\nexactly the nihilistic or ideologically possessed state that Nietzsche\\nand Dostoevsky feared, accompanied by precisely the catastrophic\\nsociological and psychological consequences they foretold.\\n\\nIt is also by no means self-evident that value, subjective though it\\n\\nappears to be, is not an integral part of reality, despite the\\nundeniable utility of the scientific method. The central scientific\\naxiom left to us by the Enlightenment—that reality is the exclusive\\ndomain of the objective—poses a fatal challenge to the reality of\\nreligious experience, if the latter experience is fundamentally\\nsubjective (and it appears to be exactly that). But there is something\\ncomplicating the situation that seems to lie between the subjective\\nand the objective: What if there are experiences that typically\\nmanifest themselves to one person at a time (as seems to be the case\\nwith much of revelation), but appear to form a meaningful pattern\\nwhen considered collectively? That indicates something is occurring\\nthat is not merely subjective, even though it cannot be easily pinned\\ndown with the existing methods of science. It could be, instead, that\\nthe value of something is sufficiently idiosyncratic—sufficiently\\ndependent on the particularities of time, place, and the individual\\nexperiencing that thing—that it cannot be fixed and replicated in the\\nmanner required for it to exist as a scientific object. This does not\\nmean, however, that value is not real: It means only that it is so\\ncomplex that it cannot yet and may never fit itself within the\\n\\n\\x0cscientific worldview. The world is a very strange place, and there are\\ntimes when the metaphorical or narrative description characteristic\\nof culture and the material representation so integral to science\\nappear to touch, when everything comes together—when life and art\\nreflect each other equally.\\n\\nThe psyche—the soul—that produces or is the recipient of such\\nexperiences appears incontrovertibly real: the proof lying not least in\\nour actions. We all axiomatically assume the reality of our individual\\nexistences and conscious experiences, and we extend the same\\ncourtesy to others (or else). It is by no means unreasonable to\\nsuggest that such existence and experience has a deep underlying\\nbiological and physical structure. Those with a psychoanalytic bent\\ncertainly assume so, as do many who study biological psychology,\\nparticularly if they focus on motivation and emotion.5 That structure,\\naccepted as a given by scientists and by the general population in\\nequal measure, appears to manifest religious experience as part of its\\nbasic function—and that religious function has enough commonality\\nacross people to make us at least understand what “religious\\nexperience” means—particularly if we have had a taste of it at some\\npoint in life.\\n\\nWhat does that imply? It might be that the true meaning of life is\\n\\navailable for discovery, if it can be discovered at all, by each\\nindividual, alone—although in communication with others, past and\\npresent. It may well be, therefore, that the true meaning of life is not\\nto be found in what is objective, but in what is subjective (but still\\nuniversal). The existence of conscience, for example, provides some\\nevidence for that, as does the fact that religious experiences can\\nreliably be induced chemically, as well as through practices such as\\ndancing, chanting, fasting, and meditating. Additionally, the fact that\\nreligious ideas are capable of uniting vast numbers of people under a\\nsingle moral umbrella (although such ideas can divide across sects,\\nas well) also indicates something universal calling from within. Why\\ndo we so easily assume that nothing about that is real, given its\\napparent commonality and necessity—given, as well, the near\\ncertainty that the capacity for valuing is an ancient evolved function,\\nselected for by the very reality we are attempting to define and\\nunderstand?\\n\\nWe have seen the consequences of the totalitarian alternatives in\\nwhich the collective is supposed to bear the burdens of life, lay out\\n\\n\\x0cthe proper pathway, and transform the terrible world into the\\npromised utopia. The communists produced a worldview that was\\nattractive to fair-minded people, as well as those who were envious\\nand cruel. Perhaps communism may even have been a viable solution\\nto the problems of the unequal distribution of wealth that\\ncharacterized the industrial age, if all of the hypothetically oppressed\\nwere good people and all of the evil was to be found, as hypothesized,\\nin their bourgeoisie overlords. Unfortunately for the communists, a\\nsubstantial proportion of the oppressed were incapable,\\nunconscientious, unintelligent, licentious, power mad, violent,\\nresentful, and jealous, while a substantial proportion of the\\noppressors were educated, able, creative, intelligent, honest, and\\ncaring. When the frenzy of dekulakization swept through the newly\\nestablished Soviet Union, it was vengeful and jealous murderers who\\nwere redistributing property, while it was competent and reliable\\nfarmers, for the most part, from whom it was violently taken. One\\nunintended consequence of that “redistribution” of good fortune was\\nthe starvation of six million Ukrainians in the 1930s, in the midst of\\nsome of the most fertile land in the world.\\n\\nThe other major villains of the twentieth century, Germany’s\\nNational Socialists, were, of course, also powerful and dangerous\\nideologues. It has been suggested that Hitler’s acolytes were inspired\\nby Nietzsche’s philosophy. This claim may hold some truth in a\\nperverse manner, as they were certainly trying to create their own\\nvalues, although not as the individuals whose development the\\nphilosopher promoted. It is more reasonable to say that Nietzsche\\nidentified the cultural and historical conditions that made the rise to\\ninfluence of ideas akin to those promoted by the Nazis extremely\\nlikely. The Nazis were trying to create a post-Christian, postreligious\\nperfect man, the ideal Aryan, and certainly formulated that ideal in a\\nmanner not in accordance with the dictates of either Judaism or\\nChristianity. Thus, the perfect Aryan could be and certainly was\\nconceptualized by the Nazis as a “higher man.” This does not mean\\nthat the Nazi ideal as postulated bore any resemblance to the\\nNietzschean ideal. Quite the contrary: Nietzsche was a fervent\\nadmirer of individuality and would have considered the idea of the\\nhigher man as state creation both absurd and abhorrent.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nConsider those who have not gone so far as to adopt the discredited\\nideologies of the Marxist-Leninists and the Nazis, but who still\\nmaintain faith in the commonplace isms characterizing the modern\\nworld: conservatism, socialism, feminism (and all manner of ethnic-\\nand gender-study isms), postmodernism, and environmentalism,\\namong others. They are all monotheists, practically speaking—or\\npolytheistic worshippers of a very small number of gods. These gods\\nare the axioms and foundational beliefs that must be accepted, a\\npriori, rather than proven, before the belief system can be adopted,\\nand when accepted and applied to the world allow the illusion to\\nprevail that knowledge has been produced.\\n\\nThe process by which an ism system can be generated is simple in\\nits initial stages but baroque enough in its application to mimic (and\\nreplace) actual productive theorizing. The ideologue begins by\\nselecting a few abstractions in whose low-resolution representations\\nhide large, undifferentiated chunks of the world. Some examples\\ninclude “the economy,” “the nation,” “the environment,” “the\\npatriarchy,” “the people,” “the rich,” “the poor,” “the oppressed,” and\\n“the oppressors.” The use of single terms implicitly hypersimplifies\\nwhat are in fact extraordinarily diverse and complex phenomena\\n(that masked complexity is part of the reason that the terms come to\\ncarry so much emotional weight). There are many reasons, for\\nexample, why people are poor. Lack of money is the obvious cause—\\nbut that hypothetical obviousness is part of the problem with\\nideology. Lack of education, broken families, crime-ridden\\nneighborhoods, alcoholism, drug abuse, criminality and corruption\\n(and the political and economic exploitation that accompanies it),\\nmental illness, lack of a life plan (or even failure to realize that\\nformulating such a plan is possible or necessary), low\\nconscientiousness, unfortunate geographical locale, shift in the\\neconomic landscape and the consequent disappearance of entire\\nfields of endeavor, the marked proclivity for those who are rich to get\\nricher still and the poor to get poorer, low creativity/entrepreneurial\\ninterest, lack of encouragement—these are but a few of the manifold\\nproblems that generate poverty, and the solution to each (assuming\\nthat a solution exists) is by no means obviously the same. Nor are the\\n\\n\\x0cvillains hiding behind each putative and differentiable cause the\\nsame villains (assuming that there are even villains to be found).\\n\\nAll such problems require careful, particularized analysis, followed\\n\\nby the generation of multiple potential solutions, followed by the\\ncareful assessment of those solutions to ensure that they are having\\ntheir desired effect. It is uncommon to see any serious social problem\\naddressed so methodically. It is also rare that the solutions\\ngenerated, even by methodical process, produce the intended\\noutcome. The great difficulty of assessing problems in sufficient\\ndetail to understand what is causing them, followed by the equally\\ngreat difficulty of generating and testing particularized solutions, is\\nsufficient to deter even the stouthearted, let us say, from daring to\\ntackle a true plague of mankind. Since the ideologue can place him or\\nherself on the morally correct side of the equation without the\\ngenuine effort necessary to do so validly, it is much easier and more\\nimmediately gratifying to reduce the problem to something simple\\nand accompany it with an evildoer, who can then be morally\\nopposed.\\n\\nAfter breaking the world into large, undifferentiated pieces,\\ndescribing the problem(s) that characterize each division, and\\nidentifying the appropriate villains, the ism theorist then generates a\\nsmall number of explanatory principles or forces (which may indeed\\ncontribute in some part to the understanding or existence of those\\nabstracted entities). Then he or she grants to that small number\\nprimary causal power, while ignoring others of equal or greater\\nimportance. It is most effective to utilize a major motivational system\\nor large-scale sociological fact or conjecture for such purposes. It is\\nalso good to select those explanatory principles for an unstated\\nnegative, resentful, and destructive reason, and then make\\ndiscussion of the latter and the reason for their existence taboo for\\nthe ideologue and his or her followers (to say nothing of the critics).\\nNext, the faux theorist spins a post-hoc theory about how every\\nphenomenon, no matter how complex, can be considered a\\nsecondary consequence of the new, totalizing system. Finally, a\\nschool of thought emerges to propagate the methods of this\\nalgorithmic reduction (particularly when the thinker is hoping to\\nattain dominance in the conceptual and the real worlds), and those\\nwho refuse to adopt the algorithm or who criticize its use are tacitly\\nor explicitly demonized.\\n\\n\\x0cIncompetent and corrupt intellectuals thrive on such activity, such\\ngames. The first players of a given game of this sort are generally the\\nbrightest of the participants. They weave a story around their causal\\nprinciple of choice, demonstrating how that hypothetically primary\\nmotivational force profoundly contributed to any given domain of\\nhuman activity. Sometimes this is even helpful, as such activity may\\nshed light on how a motivation heretofore taboo to discuss or\\nconsider might play a larger role in affecting human behavior and\\nperception than was previously deemed acceptable (this is what\\nhappened, for example, with Freud, and his emphasis on sex). Their\\nfollowers, desperate to join a potentially masterable new dominance\\nhierarchy (the old one being cluttered by its current occupants),\\nbecome enamored of that story. While doing so, being less bright\\nthan those they follow, they subtly shift “contributed to” or “affected”\\nto “caused.” The originator(s), gratified by the emergence of\\nfollowers, start to shift their story in that direction as well. Or they\\nobject, but it does not matter. The cult has already begun.\\n\\nThis kind of theorizing is particularly attractive to people who are\\nsmart but lazy. Cynicism serves as an aid, too, as does arrogance. The\\nnew adherents will be taught that mastering such a game constitutes\\neducation, and will learn to criticize alternative theories, different\\nmethods, and increasingly, even the idea of fact itself. If an\\nimpenetrable vocabulary accompanies the theory, so much the\\nbetter. It will then take potential critics some valuable time even to\\nlearn to decode the arguments. And there is a conspiratorial aspect\\nthat rapidly comes to pervade the school where such “education”\\noccurs, and where such activity is increasingly all that is permitted:\\nDo not criticize the theory—and do not get singled out. Do not\\nbecome unpopular. Even: Do not receive a bad grade, or a poor\\nreview, for expressing a taboo opinion (and even when this does not\\noccur in practice, the fear that it might keeps many students and\\nprofessors, or employees and employers, in check).\\n\\nFreud, as we noted, attempted to reduce motivation to sexuality,\\n\\nto libido. The same can be done quite effectively by anyone\\nsufficiently literate, intelligent, and verbally fluent. This is because\\n“sexuality” (like any multifaceted single term) can be defined as\\ntightly or as loosely as necessary by those who use it for\\ncomprehensively explanatory purposes. No matter how defined, sex\\nis a crucially important biological phenomenon—key to complex life\\n\\n\\x0citself—and its influence may therefore be genuinely detected or\\nplausibly invented in any important field of endeavor and then\\nexaggerated (while other factors of significant import are diminished\\nin importance). In this manner, the single explanatory principle can\\nbe expanded indefinitely, in keeping with the demands placed upon\\nit.\\n\\nMarx did the same thing when he described man in a\\n\\nfundamentally economic, class-based manner, and history as the\\neternal battleground of bourgeoisie and proletariat. Everything can\\nbe explained by running it through a Marxist algorithm. The wealthy\\nare wealthy because they exploit the poor. The poor are poor because\\nthey are exploited by the wealthy. All economic inequality is\\nundesirable, unproductive, and a consequence of fundamental\\nunfairness and corruption. There is, of course—as in the case of\\nFreud—some value in Marx’s observations. Class is an important\\nelement of social hierarchies, and tends to maintain itself with a\\ncertain stability across time. Economic well-being, or the lack\\nthereof, is of crucial significance. And the damnable fact of the\\nPareto distribution6—the tendency of those who have more to get\\nmore (which seems to apply in any economic system)—does mean\\nthat wealth accumulates in the hands of a minority of people. The\\npeople who make up that minority do change substantively,\\nregardless of the aforementioned class stability,7 and that is a crucial\\npoint, but the fact that the comparatively rich are always a minority—\\nand a small one, at that—seems dismally immutable.\\nRegardless of its hypothetical virtues, however, the\\n\\nimplementation of Marxism was a disaster everywhere it was\\nattempted—and that has motivated attempts by its unrepentant\\nwould-be present-day adherents to clothe its ideas in new garb and\\ncontinue forward, as if nothing of significance has changed. Thinkers\\npowerfully influenced by Marx and overwhelmingly influential in\\nmuch of the academy today (such as Michel Foucault and Jacques\\nDerrida) modified the Marxist simplification essentially by replacing\\n“economics” with “power”—as if power were the single motivating\\nforce behind all human behavior (as opposed, say, to competent\\nauthority, or reciprocity of attitude and action).\\n\\nIdeological reduction of that form is the hallmark of the most\\ndangerous of pseudo-intellectuals. Ideologues are the intellectual\\nequivalent of fundamentalists, unyielding and rigid. Their self-\\n\\n\\x0crighteousness and moral claim to social engineering is every bit as\\ndeep and dangerous. It might even be worse: ideologues lay claim to\\nrationality itself. So, they try to justify their claims as logical and\\nthoughtful. At least the fundamentalists admit devotion to something\\nthey just believe arbitrarily. They are a lot more honest.\\nFurthermore, fundamentalists are bound by a relationship with the\\ntranscendent. What this means is that God, the center of their moral\\nuniverse, remains outside and above complete understanding,\\naccording to the fundamentalist’s own creed. Right-wing Jews,\\nIslamic hard-liners, and ultra-conservative Christians must admit, if\\npushed, that God is essentially mysterious. This concession provides\\nat least some boundary for their claims, as individuals, to\\nrighteousness and power (as the genuine fundamentalist at least\\nremains subordinate to Something he cannot claim to totally\\nunderstand, let alone master). For the ideologue, however, nothing\\nremains outside understanding or mastery. An ideological theory\\nexplains everything: all the past, all the present, and all the future.\\nThis means that an ideologue can consider him or herself in\\npossession of the complete truth (something forbidden to the self-\\nconsistent fundamentalist). There is no claim more totalitarian and\\nno situation in which the worst excesses of pride are more likely to\\nmanifest themselves (and not only pride, but then deceit, once the\\nideology has failed to explain the world or predict its future).\\nThe moral of the story? Beware of intellectuals who make a\\nmonotheism out of their theories of motivation. Beware, in more\\ntechnical terms, of blanket univariate (single variable) causes for\\ndiverse, complex problems. Of course, power plays a role in history,\\nas does economics. But the same can be said of jealousy, love,\\nhunger, sex, cooperation, revelation, anger, disgust, sadness, anxiety,\\nreligion, compassion, disease, technology, hatred, and chance—none\\nof which can definitively be reduced to another. The attraction of\\ndoing so is, however, obvious: simplicity, ease, and the illusion of\\nmastery (which can have exceptionally useful psychological and\\nsocial consequences, particularly in the short term)—and, let us not\\nforget, the frequent discovery of a villain, or set of villains, upon\\nwhich the hidden motivations for the ideology can be vented.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nRessentiment8—hostile resentment—occurs when individual failure\\nor insufficient status is blamed both on the system within which that\\nfailure or lowly status occurs and then, most particularly, on the\\npeople who have achieved success and high status within that\\nsystem. The former, the system, is deemed by fiat to be unjust. The\\nsuccessful are deemed exploitative and corrupt, as they can be\\nlogically read as undeserving beneficiaries, as well as the voluntary,\\nconscious, self-serving, and immoral supporters, if the system is\\nunjust. Once this causal chain of thought has been accepted, all\\nattacks on the successful can be construed as morally justified\\nattempts at establishing justice—rather than, say, manifestations of\\nenvy and covetousness that might have traditionally been defined as\\nshameful.\\n\\nThere is another typical feature of ideological pursuit: the victims\\n\\nsupported by ideologues are always innocent (and it is sometimes\\ntrue that victims are innocent), and the perpetrators are always evil\\n(evil perpetrators are also not in short supply). But the fact that there\\nexist genuine victims and perpetrators provides no excuse to make\\nlow-resolution, blanket statements about the global locale of\\nblameless victimization and evil perpetration—particularly of the\\ntype that does not take the presumed innocence of the accused firmly\\ninto account. No group guilt should be assumed—and certainly not\\nof the multigenerational kind.9 It is a certain sign of the accuser’s evil\\nintent, and a harbinger of social catastrophe. But the advantage is\\nthat the ideologue, at little practical costs, can construe him or\\nherself both as nemesis of the oppressor and defender of the\\noppressed. Who needs the fine distinctions that determination of\\nindividual guilt or innocence demands when a prize such as that\\nbeckons?\\n\\nTo take the path of ressentiment is to risk tremendous bitterness.\\n\\nThis is in no small part a consequence of identifying the enemy\\nwithout rather than within. If wealth is the problem at issue, for\\nexample, and the wealthy perceived as the reason for poverty and all\\nthe other problems of the world, then the wealthy become the enemy\\n—indistinguishable, in some profound sense, from a degree of evil\\npositively demonic in its psychological and social significance. If\\npower is the problem, then those who have established any authority\\n\\n\\x0cat all are the singular cause of the world’s suffering. If masculinity is\\nthe problem, then all males (or even the concept of male) must be\\nattacked and vilified.* Such division of the world into the devil\\nwithout and the saint within justifies self-righteous hatred—\\nnecessitated by the morality of the ideological system itself. This is a\\nterrible trap: Once the source of evil has been identified, it becomes\\nthe duty of the righteous to eradicate it. This is an invitation to both\\nparanoia and persecution. A world where only you and people who\\nthink like you are good is also a world where you are surrounded by\\nenemies bent on your destruction, who must be fought.\\n\\nIt is much safer morally to look to yourself for the errors of the\\nworld, at least to the degree to which someone honest and free of\\nwillful blindness might consider. You are likely to be much more\\nclear minded about what is what and who is who and where blame\\nlies once you contemplate the log in your own eye, rather than the\\nspeck in your brother’s. It is probable that your own imperfections\\nare evident and plentiful, and could profitably be addressed, as step\\none in your Redeemer’s quest to improve the world. To take the\\nworld’s sins onto yourself—to assume responsibility for the fact that\\nthings have not been set right in your own life and elsewhere—is part\\nof the messianic path: part of the imitation of the hero, in the most\\nprofound of senses. This is a psychological or spiritual rather than a\\nsociological or political issue. Consider the characters fabricated by\\nsecond-rate crafters of fiction: they are simply divided into those who\\nare good and those who are evil. By contrast, sophisticated writers\\nput the divide inside the characters they create, so that each person\\nbecomes the locus of the eternal struggle between light and darkness.\\nIt is much more psychologically appropriate (and much less\\ndangerous socially) to assume that you are the enemy—that it is your\\nweaknesses and insufficiencies that are damaging the world—than to\\nassume saintlike goodness on the part of you and your party, and to\\npursue the enemy you will then be inclined to see everywhere.\\n\\nIt is impossible to fight patriarchy, reduce oppression, promote\\n\\nequality, transform capitalism, save the environment, eliminate\\ncompetitiveness, reduce government, or to run every organization\\nlike a business. Such concepts are simply too low-resolution. The\\nMonty Python comedy crew once offered satirical lessons for playing\\nthe flute: blow over one end and move your fingers up and down on\\nthe holes.10 True. But useless. The necessary detail is simply not\\n\\n\\x0cthere. Similarly, sophisticated large-scale processes and systems do\\nnot exist in a manner sufficiently real to render their comprehensive\\nunitary transformation possible. The idea that they do is the product\\nof twentieth-century cults. The beliefs of these cults are\\nsimultaneously naive and narcissistic, and the activism they promote\\nis the resentful and lazy person’s substitute for actual\\naccomplishment. The single axioms of the ideologically possessed are\\ngods, served blindly by their proselytizers.\\n\\nLike God, however, ideology is dead. The bloody excesses of the\\ntwentieth century killed it. We should let it go, and begin to address\\nand consider smaller, more precisely defined problems. We should\\nconceptualize them at the scale at which we might begin to solve\\nthem, not by blaming others, but by trying to address them\\npersonally while simultaneously taking responsibility for the\\noutcome.\\n\\nHave some humility. Clean up your bedroom. Take care of your\\n\\nfamily. Follow your conscience. Straighten up your life. Find\\nsomething productive and interesting to do and commit to it. When\\nyou can do all that, find a bigger problem and try to solve that if you\\ndare. If that works, too, move on to even more ambitious projects.\\nAnd, as the necessary beginning to that process . . . abandon\\nideology.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nWORK AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN ON AT\\nLEAST ONE THING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nWhen coal is subjected to intense heat and pressure, far below the\\nEarth’s surface, its atoms rearrange themselves into the perfect\\nrepeating crystalline alignment characterizing a diamond. The\\ncarbon that makes up coal also becomes maximally durable in its\\ndiamond form (as diamond is the hardest of all substances). Finally,\\nit becomes capable of reflecting light. This combination of durability\\nand glitter gives a diamond the qualities that justify its use as a\\nsymbol of value. That which is valuable is pure, properly aligned, and\\nglitters with light—and this is true for the person just as it is for the\\ngem. Light, of course, signifies the shining brilliance of heightened\\nand focused consciousness. Human beings are conscious during the\\nday, when it is light. Much of that consciousness is visual and\\ntherefore dependent on light. To be illumined or enlightened is to be\\nexceptionally awake and aware—to attain a state of being commonly\\nassociated with divinity. To wear a diamond is to become associated\\nwith the radiance of the Sun, like the king or queen whose profile is\\nstamped on the sunlike disc of the gold coin, a near-universal\\nstandard of worth.\\n\\nHeat and pressure transform the base matter of common coal into\\n\\nthe crystalline perfection and rare value of the diamond. The same\\ncan be said of a person. We know that the multiple forces operating\\nin the human soul are often not aligned with one another. We do the\\nthings we wish we would not do and do not do the things we know we\\nshould do. We want to be thin, but we sit on the couch eating\\n\\n\\x0cCheetos and despairing. We are directionless, confused, and\\nparalyzed by indecision. We are pulled in all directions by\\ntemptations, despite our stated will, and we waste time,\\nprocrastinate, and feel terrible about it, but we do not change.\\n\\nIt was for such reasons that archaic people found it easy to believe\\nthat the human soul was haunted by ghosts—possessed by ancestral\\nspirits, demons, and gods—none of whom necessarily had the best\\ninterests of the person at heart. Since the time of the psychoanalysts,\\nthese contrary forces, these obsessive and sometimes malevolent\\nspirits, have been conceptualized psychologically as impulses,\\nemotions, or motivational states—or as complexes, which act like\\npartial personalities united within the person by memory but not by\\nintent. Our neurological structure is indeed hierarchical. The\\npowerful instinctual servants at the bottom, governing thirst, hunger,\\nrage, sadness, elation, and lust, can easily ascend and become our\\nmasters, and just as easily wage war with one another. The resilience\\nand strength of a united spirit is not easy to attain.\\n\\nA house divided against itself, proverbially, cannot stand.\\n\\nLikewise, a poorly integrated person cannot hold himself together\\nwhen challenged. He loses union at the highest level of psychological\\norganization. He loses the properly balanced admixture of properties\\nthat is another feature of the well-tempered soul, and cannot hold his\\nself together. We know this when we say “He lost it” or “He just fell\\napart.” Before he picks up the pieces and rearranges them, such a\\nperson is likely to fall prey to domination by one or more partial\\npersonalities. This might be a spirit of rage, or anxiety, or pain,\\nleaping in to occupy the person when his temper is lost. You can see\\nthis occurring most clearly in the case of a two-year-old having a\\ntantrum. He has lost himself temporarily, and is for the moment\\npure emotion. This is an occurrence that is often deeply upsetting to\\nthe two-year-old himself, and one of an intensity that would be\\nterrifying to beholders if manifested by an adult. The archaic\\nmotivational systems governing anger merely push the toddler’s\\ndeveloping personality aside, and have their way with his mind and\\nactions. This is a true and unfortunate defeat for the still-fragile\\ncentralizing ego, struggling against powerful forces toward\\npsychological and social integration.\\n\\nLack of internal union also makes itself known in the increased\\nsuffering, magnification of anxiety, absence of motivation, and lack\\n\\n\\x0cof pleasure that accompany indecision and uncertainty. The inability\\nto decide among ten things, even when they are desirable, is\\nequivalent to torment by all of them. Without clear, well-defined,\\nand noncontradictory goals, the sense of positive engagement that\\nmakes life worthwhile is very difficult to obtain. Clear goals limit and\\nsimplify the world, as well, reducing uncertainty, anxiety, shame, and\\nthe self-devouring physiological forces unleashed by stress. The\\npoorly integrated person is thus volatile and directionless—and this\\nis only the beginning. Sufficient volatility and lack of direction can\\nrapidly conspire to produce the helplessness and depression\\ncharacteristic of prolonged futility. This is not merely a psychological\\nstate. The physical consequences of depression, often preceded by\\nexcess secretion of the stress hormone cortisol, are essentially\\nindistinguishable from rapid aging (weight gain, cardiovascular\\nproblems, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s).1\\n\\nThe social consequences are just as serious as the biological. A\\nperson who is not well put together overreacts to the slightest hint of\\nfrustration or failure. He cannot enter into productive negotiations,\\neven with himself, because he cannot tolerate the uncertainty of\\ndiscussing potential alternative futures. He cannot be pleased,\\nbecause he cannot get what he wants, and he cannot get what he\\nwants because he will not choose one thing instead of another. He\\ncan also be brought to a halt by the weakest of arguments. One of his\\nmultiple, warring subpersonalities will latch on to such arguments,\\noften contrary to his best interest, and use them, in the form of\\ndoubts, to buttress its contrarian position. A deeply conflicted person\\ncan therefore be stopped, metaphorically, with the pressure of a\\nsingle finger exerted on his chest (even though he may lash out\\nagainst such an obstacle). To move forward with resolve, it is\\nnecessary to be organized—to be directed toward something singular\\nand identifiable.\\n\\nAim. Point. All this is part of maturation and discipline, and\\n\\nsomething to be properly valued. If you aim at nothing, you become\\nplagued by everything. If you aim at nothing, you have nowhere to\\ngo, nothing to do, and nothing of high value in your life, as value\\nrequires the ranking of options and sacrifice of the lower to the\\nhigher. Do you really want to be anything you could be? Is that not\\ntoo much? Might it not be better to be something specific (and then,\\n\\n\\x0cperhaps, to add to that)? Would that not come as a relief—even\\nthough it is also a sacrifice?\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nWhen I was in graduate school at McGill University in Montreal\\nstudying for my clinical PhD, I noticed a pronounced improvement\\nin character in everyone who continued in the progressively more\\ndifficult five- to six-year program. Their social skills improved. They\\nbecame more articulate. They found a profound sense of personal\\npurpose. They served a useful function in relation to others. They\\nbecame more disciplined and organized. They had more fun. This\\nwas all despite the facts that the graduate courses were often of lower\\nquality than they might have been, the clinical placements unpaid\\nand difficult to come by, and the relationships with graduate\\nsupervisors sometimes (but by no means always) subpar. Those\\nbeginning graduate work were often still immature and confused.\\nBut the discipline imposed upon them by the necessity of research—\\nand more particularly, thesis preparation—soon improved their\\ncharacters. To write something long, sophisticated, and coherent\\nmeans, at least in part, to become more complex, articulate, and\\ndeeper in personality.\\n\\nWhen I became a professor and started mentoring undergraduate\\n\\nand graduate students, I observed the same thing. The undergrad\\npsychology students who allied themselves with a lab (and therefore\\ntook on additional work) obtained better grades than those who\\nburdened themselves less. Taking on the functions of junior\\nresearchers helped them establish a place and a community, while\\nrequiring them to discipline themselves, not least by necessitating\\nmore efficient use of their time. I observed a similar process when\\nworking as a clinical psychologist. I typically encouraged my clients\\nto choose the best path currently available to them, even if it was far\\nfrom their ideal. This sometimes meant tolerating at least a\\ntemporary decrease in ambition, or in pride, but had the advantage\\nof substituting something real for something available only in\\nfantasy. Improvements in mental health almost invariably followed.\\nIs there anything worth committing to? I am now old enough to\\n\\nhave seen what happens when the various manners in which this\\n\\n\\x0cquestion might be answered manifest themselves. In my career as\\nundergraduate, graduate student, professor, clinical psychologist,\\nresearcher, and in my various additional forays, I have seen the same\\ntwin paths of development manifest themselves repeatedly. Both are\\navailable, in principle, to everyone—to each of the half-developed,\\nwandering, prematurely cynical, questioning, doubtful, and hopeful\\nfools that we all are to varying degrees when young and on the brink\\nof adulthood. It has become self-evident to me that many\\ncommitments have enduring value: those of character, love, family,\\nfriendship, and career foremost among them (and perhaps in that\\norder). Those who remain unable or unwilling to establish a well-\\ntended garden, so to speak, in any or all those domains inevitably\\nsuffer because of it. However, commitment requires its pound of\\nflesh. To pursue an undergraduate degree means sacrifice and study,\\nand the choice of a given discipline means forgoing the possibility of\\nother pathways of study. The same goes for selecting a partner or\\ngroup of friends. Cynicism about such things, or mere indecision or\\ndoubt, finds an easy but truly adversarial ally in the mindlessly\\nnihilistic rationality that undermines everything: Why bother? What\\ndifference is it going to make in a thousand years? What makes one\\npathway preferable to another—or to none—anyway?\\n\\nIt is possible to be content, or even happy, with one partner or\\nanother, or with one group of friends or another, or with one career\\nor another. In some sense, the satisfaction that these arrangements\\nbring could have been generated by different choices. They are also\\neach deeply flawed: romantic partners can be fickle and complex, as\\ncan friends, and every career or job is characterized by frustration,\\ndisappointment, corruption, arbitrary hierarchy, internal politics,\\nand sheer idiocy of decision making. We could conclude from that\\nlack of specific or ideal value that nothing matters more than\\nanything else—or to draw the even more hopeless allied conclusion\\nthat nothing therefore matters at all. But those who draw such\\nconclusions, no matter how well armed they are with rationally\\ncoherent arguments, pay a high price. People suffer for it if they quit\\nbefore completing an undergraduate degree or the study of a trade.\\nAnd this means “quit,” not fail, although the two can be difficult to\\ndistinguish. Sometimes people fail because they just cannot manage\\nthe job, despite good intentions and necessary discipline. It takes a\\ncertain verbal capacity to operate effectively as a lawyer, and a\\n\\n\\x0ccertain degree of facility with mechanical objects, for example, to\\nbecome a carpenter. Sometimes the match between person and\\nchoice is so poor that even commitment will not suffice to bring\\nabout the desired end. But very often failure is a consequence of\\ninsufficient single-mindedness, elaborate but pointless\\nrationalization, and rejection of responsibility. And little good comes\\nof that.\\n\\nPeople who do not choose a job or a career commonly become\\nunmoored and drift. They may attempt to justify that drifting with a\\nfacade of romantic rebelliousness or prematurely world-weary\\ncynicism. They may turn to casual identification with avant-garde\\nartistic exploration or treat the attendant despair and aimlessness\\nwith the pursuit of hard-core alcohol and drug use and their instant\\ngratifications. But none of that makes for a successful thirty-year-old\\n(let alone someone a decade older). The same holds true for people\\nwho cannot choose and then commit to a single romantic partner, or\\nare unable or unwilling to be loyal to their friends. They become\\nlonely, isolated, and miserable, and all that merely adds the\\nadditional depth of bitterness to the cynicism that spurred the\\nisolation in the first place. That is not the sort of vicious circle that\\nyou want to characterize your life.\\n\\nThe people I knew who finished their undergraduate degrees or\\n\\ntrade programs were better for it. Not “good,” necessarily. Not\\nfunctioning optimally. Not necessarily thrilled with their choices, or\\ndevoid of doubt and misgiving. Not even certain to continue in\\npursuit of what they had studied. But far better than those who\\nwithdrew and drifted. The commitments and the sacrifices thereby\\nentailed matured those who endured and made them better people.\\nSo, what is the conclusion? There are many things to which we might\\ncommit ourselves. A case can be made for the arbitrary and even\\nmeaningless nature of any given commitment, given the plethora of\\nalternatives, given the corruption of the systems demanding that\\ncommitment. But the same case cannot be made for the fact of\\ncommitment itself: Those who do not choose a direction are lost. It is\\nfar better to become something than to remain anything but become\\nnothing. This is despite all the genuine limitations and\\ndisappointments that becoming something entails. Everywhere, the\\ncynic despairs, are bad decisions. But someone who has transcended\\nthat cynicism (or more accurately, replaced it with an even more\\n\\n\\x0cprofound doubt—that is, the doubt that doubt itself is an ultimately\\nreliable guide) objects: the worst decision of all is none.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe discipline that enables concentration on one thing begins young.\\nAt a very early age, children begin to order the multiplicity of\\nemotions and motivations that constitute their basic instincts of\\nsurvival into the strategies of cooperation and competition that\\ninvolve others, voluntarily—and children who are well constituted\\nand fortunate manage this in a manner that is simultaneously\\nsocially desirable and psychologically healthy. When a child’s self-\\ndirected experience is interrupted by the emergence of an instinctual\\nsystem (when the child is hungry, angry, tired, or cold), the good\\nparent steps in, solving the problem disrupting the child’s fragile\\nunity or, better yet, teaching the child to solve the problem himself.\\nWhen the latter process has been completed with sufficient\\nthoroughness, the child is ready to join the social world. This must\\nhappen by the age of four, or it may never happen.2 A child must be\\nsufficiently self-organizing to be desirable to his or her peers by the\\nage of four or risk permanent social ostracism. A child who is still\\nhaving temper tantrums by that age runs precisely that risk.\\n\\nThe process of integration is furthered by peers—friends—for the\\nchild well trained or fortunate enough to be accepted. When a child\\nplays a game with others, she is disciplining herself. She is learning\\nto subordinate all her competing impulses to the dictates of that\\ngame—one thing, despite the potential multiplicity of rules; learning\\nto subjugate herself voluntarily to its rules and well-defined goals. To\\nplay in such a manner, she must transform herself into a functional\\nsubunit of a larger social machine. This can be interpreted as a\\nsacrifice of individuality, if individuality is defined as limitless choice\\nof impulsive gratification. But it is much more accurately\\ndevelopment of individuality, considered at a higher level: the\\nproperly functioning and integrated individual tempers the desires of\\nthe present with the necessities of the future (including the necessity\\nof playing well with others). It is in this manner that the multifarious\\ngames of childhood temper the screaming cacophony of late infancy.\\n\\n\\x0cThe payoff for such development is, of course, the security of social\\ninclusion, and the pleasure of the game.\\n\\nThis, it should be noted, is not repression. This point must be\\nmade clear, as people believe that the things discipline imposed by\\nchoice prevents us from doing will somehow be lost forever. It is this\\nbelief, in large part—often expressed with regard to creativity—that\\nmakes so many parents afraid of damaging their children by\\ndisciplining them. But proper discipline organizes rather than\\ndestroys. A child terrified into obedience or shielded from every\\npossible chance of misbehavior is not disciplined, but abused. A child\\nwho has been disciplined properly, by contrast—by parents, other\\nadults, and most significantly, by other children—does not battle\\nwith, defeat, and then permanently inhibit her aggression. Such a\\nchild does not even sublimate that aggression, or transform it into\\nsomething different. Instead, she integrates it into her increasingly\\nsophisticated game-playing ability, allowing it to feed her\\ncompetitiveness and heighten her attention, and making it serve the\\nhigher purposes of her developing psyche. A well-socialized child\\ndoes not therefore lack aggression. She just becomes extremely good\\nat being aggressive, transmuting what might otherwise be a\\ndisruptive drive into the focused perseverance and controlled\\ncompetitiveness that make for a successful player. By the dawn of\\nadolescence, such a child can organize herself into ever more\\ncomplex games—joint, goal-directed activities that everyone plays\\nvoluntarily, and that everyone enjoys and benefits from, even if only\\none person or one team can win at a time. This ability is civilization\\nitself in its nascent form, at the level of the individual player and\\ngroup. This is where both cooperation and the opportunity to\\ncompete and win make themselves simultaneously manifest. This is\\nall necessary preparation for the more permanent choices that must\\nbe made for a successful adulthood.\\n\\nIt is certainly possible—and reasonable—to have some doubt and\\nto argue about which game might best be played here and now; but it\\nis not reasonable to state that all games are therefore unnecessary.\\nLikewise, although it may be possible to argue about which morality\\nis the necessary morality, it is not possible to argue that morality\\nitself is thus unnecessary. Doubt about which game is appropriate\\nright now is not relativism. It is the intelligent consideration of\\ncontext. The fact that happiness is not appropriate, for example, at a\\n\\n\\x0cfuneral, does not mean that happiness itself lacks value. Likewise,\\nthe claim that morality is both necessary and inevitable is not\\ntotalitarian. It is merely the observation that basic, primitive\\nunidimensional values must be subsumed under socially organized\\nstructures for peace and harmony to exist and be maintained. It was\\nthe bringing together of a warring multiplicity under the unifying\\ndoctrines of Christianity that civilized Europe. It could, perhaps,\\nhave been Buddhism, Confucianism, or Hinduism, insofar as the\\nEast is also both broadly civilized and unified. But it could not have\\nbeen the absence of any doctrine whatsoever. Without a game, there\\nis no peace, only chaos. Furthermore, the game that exists must be\\nplayable (as we discussed in Rule IV: Notice that opportunity lurks\\nwhere responsibility has been abdicated). This means that it must be\\nstructured by a communally acceptable set of rules—by only those\\nconstraints that many people are willing to abide by, for a long time.\\nIt is possible that many such games exist, theoretically, but it is at\\nleast equally possible that there are only a few. In any case, the rules\\nof Christianity and the rules of Buddhism are by no means arbitrary,\\nby no means nonsensical superstition, any more than the rules of a\\nplayable game are merely arbitrary or nonsensically superstitious. To\\nthink that peace can exist without the overarching and voluntarily\\naccepted game is to misunderstand the ever-present danger of the\\nfragmented tribalism to which we can so easily and devastatingly\\nregress.\\n\\nOnce the social world has forced the child to integrate his multiple\\n\\nsubpersonalities, he can play with others. After that, he should be\\nready to engage in the more serious games that make up jobs or\\nprofessions, with their highly structured expectations, skills, and\\nrules. He must learn those, as well as—when older—the dance of the\\nsexes. He must integrate his socialized personality with that of\\nanother, so that the couple he makes with that other can exist\\ntogether peacefully, productively, within society, over the long term\\n—while maintaining voluntary willingness to do so. This is the dual\\nprocess of psychological and social integration that accompanies\\napprenticeship, all associated with the outsourcing of sanity.\\nAdherence to this process will make him a socially sophisticated,\\nproductive, and psychologically healthy adult, capable of true\\nreciprocity (and, perhaps, the temporary suspension of the demand\\nof reciprocity necessary to raise children).\\n\\n\\x0cBut the story of integration and socialization does not end here.\\n\\nThis is because two things are happening at once, during an\\napprenticeship worthy of the name (just as learning to play a game\\nand learning to be a good sport happen at the same time, while\\nplaying). Initially, the apprentice must become a servant of tradition,\\nof structure, and of dogma, just as the child who wants to play must\\nfollow the rules of the game. At its best, this servitude means grateful\\nalliance, in one form or another, with the institutions typically\\nconsidered patriarchal. Apprenticeship means heat and pressure (as\\nnew workmen are tried by their peers, as articling law students are\\ntried by their employers, as medical residents are tried by physicians,\\nnurses, and patients). The goal of this heat and pressure is\\nsubordination of an undeveloped personality (by no means\\n“individual” at this point) to a single path, for the purposes of\\ntransformation from undisciplined beginner to accomplished master.\\n\\nThe master, who is the rightful product of apprenticeship, is,\\n\\nhowever, no longer the servant of dogma. Instead, he is now himself\\nserved by dogma, which he has the responsibility to maintain as well\\nas the right to change, when change is necessary. This makes the\\nmaster, who once allowed himself to be enslaved, an emergent\\nfollower of spirit—the wind (spirit) that bloweth where it listeth\\n(John 3:8). The master can allow himself his intuitions, as the\\nknowledge obtained by the discipline he has acquired will enable him\\nto criticize his own ideas and assess their true value. He may\\ntherefore more clearly perceive the fundamental patterns or\\nprinciples that underlie the dogmas of his discipline, and draw\\ninspiration from those, instead of blindly adhering to the rules as\\ncurrently articulated or embodied. He may even rely on the\\nintegrated union of his personality and his training to modify or\\ntransform even those more fundamental, deeply intuited principles,\\nin the service of an even higher union.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe limiting disciplines that serve both as precondition for a game\\nand for the development of a unity of being can usefully be\\nconsidered Thou Shalt Nots—rules that highlight what is definitely\\nnot to be done, while whatever is supposed to be done is taking place.\\n\\n\\x0cAbiding by these rules produces a development of character—\\ncharacter with a particular nature or essence (we have already\\ndiscussed this as, say, the development of personal desirability as a\\nplayer of many games, or sequences of games). As is the case in many\\nother situations, it appears that this idea is already implicit in the\\nstories that make up the bedrock of our culture. This is particularly\\nevident in the Gospel of Mark, which is a commentary on what are\\namong the most influential Rules of the Game ever formulated—the\\nMosaic Ten Commandments (and, even more broadly, a commentary\\non rules themselves). The commandments follow:\\n\\n1. Though shalt have no other gods before me.\\n2. Though shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\\n3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\\n4.

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\\n\\n10. Thou shalt not covet.\\n\\nThe first speaks to the necessity of aiming at the highest possible\\n\\nunity; the second to the danger of worshipping false idols (by\\nconfusing the representation, or the image, with the ineffable it is\\nsupposed to represent); the third means that it is wrong to claim\\nmoral inspiration from God while knowingly committing sinful acts;\\nthe fourth means that it is necessary to leave time to regularly\\nconsider what is truly valuable or sacred; the fifth keeps families\\ntogether, mandating honor, respect, and gratitude from children as\\njust reward for the sacrifices made by parents; the sixth prevents\\nmurder (obviously) but, by doing so, also protects the community\\nfrom potential descent into constant and potentially\\nmultigenerational feuding; the seventh mandates the sacredness of\\nthe marriage vow, predicated on the assumption (like the fifth) that\\nthe stability and value of the family is of paramount importance; the\\neighth allows for honest, hardworking people to reap the benefits of\\ntheir efforts without fear that what they have produced will be taken\\n\\n\\x0cfrom them arbitrarily (and, thereby, makes civilized society a\\npossibility); the ninth maintains the integrity of the law, reducing or\\neliminating its use as a weapon; and the tenth is a reminder that\\nenvy and the resentment it breeds is a destructive force of the highest\\npower.\\n\\nIt is worthwhile thinking of these Commandments as a minimum\\n\\nset of rules for a stable society—an iterable social game. The\\nCommandments are rules established in the book of Exodus, and\\npart of that unforgettable story. But they are also pointers to\\nsomething else—something that simultaneously emerges from and\\ntranscends the rules and constitutes their essence. The core idea is\\nthis: subjugate yourself voluntarily to a set of socially determined\\nrules—those with some tradition in their formulation—and a unity\\nthat transcends the rules will emerge. That unity constitutes what\\nyou could be, if you concentrate on a particular goal and see it\\nthrough.\\n\\nThere is a story relevant to this idea in the Gospel of Mark. The\\n\\npertinent section begins with Christ journeying to the temple of\\nJerusalem, where He casts out the moneychangers and merchants\\nand addresses the crowd with an irresistible charisma. And, as the\\ntale goes, “the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they\\nmight destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was\\nastonished at his doctrine” (Mark 11:18). In consequence, they begin\\nto conspire, questioning this strange prophet, hoping to entice Him\\ninto a heretical and therefore potentially fatal statement, sending to\\nHim “certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in\\nhis words” (Mark 12:13). Christ deals masterfully, to say the least,\\nwith the questioners, reducing them to an aggrieved and resentful\\nsilence. The section ends with what is arguably the most difficult and\\ntreacherous of questions, posed by a particularly cunning but also\\nperhaps begrudgingly admiring interlocutor (Mark 12:28–34):\\n\\nAnd one of the scribes came, and having heard them\\nreasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered\\nthem well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of\\nall?\\n\\nAnd Jesus answered him, The first of all the\\n\\ncommandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one\\n\\n\\x0cLord:\\n\\nAnd thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\\n\\nand with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all\\nthy strength: this is the first commandment.\\n\\nAnd the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy\\n\\nneighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment\\ngreater than these.\\n\\nAnd the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast\\nsaid the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other\\nbut he:\\n\\nAnd to love him with all the heart, and with all the\\nunderstanding, and with all the soul, and with all the\\nstrength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than\\nall whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\\n\\nAnd when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said\\n\\nunto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And\\nno man after that durst ask him any question.\\n\\nWhat does this all mean? The personality integrated by disciplined\\n\\nadherence to a set of appropriate rules is simultaneously (although\\nperhaps unknowingly) guided by or imitating the highest possible\\nideal—precisely that ideal that constitutes whatever common\\nelement of “moral” makes all the rules good, just, and necessary.\\nThat ideal, according to Christ’s answer, is something singular (the\\n“one Lord”), thoroughly embodied (loved with “all thy heart,” “soul,”\\n“understanding,” and “strength”), and then manifested as a love that\\nis identical for self and all mankind.\\n\\nWestern culture is “unconsciously” underpinned by a very\\n\\nprofound drama, reflecting all this, because of its origin in Judeo-\\nChristian conceptualization. Psychologically speaking, Christ is a\\nrepresentation, or an embodiment, of the mastery of dogma and the\\n(consequent) emergence of spirit. Spirit is the creative force that\\ngives rise to what becomes dogma, with time. Spirit is also that which\\nconstantly transcends such time-honored tradition, when possible. It\\nis for this reason that an apprenticeship ends with a masterpiece, the\\ncreation of which signifies not only the acquisition of the requisite\\nskill, but the acquisition of the ability to create new skills.\\n\\n\\x0cAlthough Christ commits many acts that might be considered\\nrevolutionary, as we discussed in Rule I, He is nonetheless explicitly\\nportrayed in the Gospels as the master of tradition, and says of\\nHimself, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the\\nprophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17,\\nKJV). The New International Version of the Bible perhaps puts it\\nmore comprehensibly: “Do not think that I have come to abolish the\\nLaw or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill\\nthem.” Christ therefore presents Himself as both the product of\\ntradition, and the very thing that creates and transforms it. The same\\npattern of creative conflict pervades the Old Testament, which is in\\nlarge part a series of stories about the spirit in prophetic opposition\\nto the inevitable corruption of dogma harnessed to serve power. It is\\nthe personality who mimics that model who might be regarded as\\ntruly Western, in the deepest of psychological senses.\\n\\nIf you work as hard as you can on one thing, you will change. You\\n\\nwill start to also become one thing, instead of the clamoring\\nmultitude you once were. That one thing, developed properly, is not\\nonly the disciplined entity formed by sacrifice, commitment, and\\nconcentration. It is that which creates, destroys, and transforms\\ndiscipline itself—civilization itself—by expressing its unity of\\npersonality and society. It is the very Word of truth, upon whose\\nfunction all habitable order, wrenched out of chaos, eternally\\ndepends.\\n\\nWork as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see\\n\\nwhat happens.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nTRY TO MAKE ONE ROOM IN YOUR HOME AS\\nBEAUTIFUL AS POSSIBLE\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI have become known for encouraging people to clean up their\\nrooms. Perhaps that is because I am serious about that prosaic piece\\nof advice, and because I know that it is a much more difficult task\\nthan it appears. I have been unsuccessfully cleaning up my room, by\\nthe way—my home office (which I generally keep in relatively\\npristine condition)—for about three years now. My life was thrown\\ninto such chaos over that period by the multitude of changes I\\nexperienced—political controversies, transformation of career,\\nendless travel, mountains of mail, the sequence of illnesses—that I\\nsimply became overwhelmed. The disorganization was heightened by\\nthe fact that my wife and I had just finished having much of our\\nhouse renovated, and everything we could not find a proper place for\\nended up in my office.\\n\\nThere is a meme floating around the internet, accusing me of\\nhypocrisy on account of this: a still taken from a video I shot in my\\noffice, with a fair bit of mess in the background (and I cannot say\\nthat I look much better myself). Who am I to tell people to clean up\\ntheir rooms before attempting to fix the rest of the world when,\\napparently, I cannot do it myself? And there is something directly\\nsynchronistic and meaningful about that objection, because I am not\\nin proper order at that moment myself, and my condition\\nundoubtedly found its reflection in the state of my office. More piled\\nup every day, as I traveled, and everything collected around me. I\\nplead exceptional circumstances, and I put many other things in\\n\\n\\x0corder during the time my office was degenerating, but I still have a\\nmoral obligation to get back in there and put it right. And the\\nproblem is not just that I want to clean up the mess. I also want to\\nmake it beautiful: my room, my house, and then, perhaps, in\\nwhatever way I can manage, the community. God knows it is crying\\nout for it.\\n\\nMaking something beautiful is difficult, but it is amazingly\\nworthwhile. If you learn to make something in your life truly\\nbeautiful—even one thing—then you have established a relationship\\nwith beauty. From there you can begin to expand that relationship\\nout into other elements of your life and the world. That is an\\ninvitation to the divine. That is the reconnection with the\\nimmortality of childhood, and the true beauty and majesty of the\\nBeing you can no longer see. You must be daring to try that.\\n\\nIf you study art (and literature and the humanities), you do it so\\n\\nthat you can familiarize yourself with the collected wisdom of our\\ncivilization. This is a very good idea—a veritable necessity—because\\npeople have been working out how to live for a long time. What they\\nhave produced is strange but also rich beyond comparison, so why\\nnot use it as a guide? Your vision will be grander and your plans\\nmore comprehensive. You will consider other people more\\nintelligently and completely. You will take care of yourself more\\neffectively. You will understand the present more profoundly, rooted\\nas it is in the past, and you will come to conclusions much more\\ncarefully. You will come to treat the future, as well, as a more\\nconcrete reality (because you will have developed some true sense of\\ntime) and be less likely to sacrifice it to impulsive pleasure. You will\\ndevelop some depth, gravitas, and true thoughtfulness. You will\\nspeak more precisely, and other people will become more likely to\\nlisten to and cooperate productively with you, as you will with them.\\nYou will become more your own person, and less a dull and hapless\\ntool of peer pressure, vogue, fad, and ideology.\\n\\nBuy a piece of art. Find one that speaks to you and make the\\n\\npurchase. If it is a genuine artistic production, it will invade your life\\nand change it. A real piece of art is a window into the transcendent,\\nand you need that in your life, because you are finite and limited and\\nbounded by your ignorance. Unless you can make a connection to the\\ntranscendent, you will not have the strength to prevail when the\\nchallenges of life become daunting. You need to establish a link with\\n\\n\\x0cwhat is beyond you, like a man overboard in high seas requires a life\\npreserver, and the invitation of beauty into your life is one means by\\nwhich that may be accomplished.\\n\\nIt is for such reasons that we need to understand the role of art,\\n\\nand stop thinking about it as an option, or a luxury, or worse, an\\naffectation. Art is the bedrock of culture itself. It is the foundation of\\nthe process by which we unite ourselves psychologically, and come to\\nestablish productive peace with others. As it is said, “Man shall not\\nlive by bread alone” (Matthew 4:4). That is exactly right. We live by\\nbeauty. We live by literature. We live by art. We cannot live without\\nsome connection to the divine—and beauty is divine—because in its\\nabsence life is too short, too dismal, and too tragic. And we must be\\nsharp and awake and prepared so that we can survive properly, and\\norient the world properly, and not destroy things, including\\nourselves—and beauty can help us appreciate the wonder of Being\\nand motivate us to seek gratitude when we might otherwise be prone\\nto destructive resentment.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe pride of the peacock is the glory of God.\\nThe lust of the goat is the bounty of God.\\nThe wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.\\nThe nakedness of woman is the work of God.\\nExcess of sorrow laughs.

I knew the back alleys, the\\nplaces behind the fences, the location of each crack in the pavement,\\nand the shortcuts that could be taken from one place to another. My\\ngeographical locale was not large, but I had explored it thoroughly\\nand my knowledge of it was very detailed. Now that I am an adult,\\n\\n\\x0cthe same is not true. I lived in Fairview, the town I grew up in for\\nmost of my childhood and adolescence, for only nine years, but I am\\nstill able to picture in high resolution the street I lived on. I have\\nlived in Toronto, on the same street, for more than twice as long, but\\nI still have only a vague sense of the houses that surround mine.\\n\\nI do not think that is a good thing. I feel far less at home because\\n\\nof it. It is as if when I walk down the street and glance at a local\\nhouse, I think of “house” as an icon (because, really, what practical\\ndifference does it make to me what particularities characterize each\\nhouse?), and then my attention is turned to something else. I do not\\nsee the house, with its specific shingles, colors, flowers, and\\narchitectural details, despite the interest that might have been\\nelicited in me had I paid careful attention. By this point in my life, I\\nhave seen so many houses in so many places that I know what a\\nhouse is likely to do when I walk by it—which is very little. Thus, I\\nignore the engaging idiosyncrasies and beauties of its details—its\\nunique character, for better or worse—and see just enough to stay\\noriented as I walk past and continue to think and be elsewhere as I\\ndo so. There is real loss in that. I am simply not there in my adult\\nneighborhood the same way I was as a child in my hometown. I am\\nseparated from the reality of the world. And a very deep feeling of\\nbelonging is missing in some important way because of that.\\n\\nPerception has been replaced for me with functional, pragmatic\\n\\nmemory. This has made me more efficient, in some ways, but the\\ncost is an impoverished experience of the richness of the world. I\\nremember when I started working as a junior professor in Boston,\\nwhen my kids were about two and three years old. I was very\\npreoccupied with my work, trying to keep up, trying to advance my\\ncareer, trying to make enough money to support my family on a\\nsingle income. I would come home and take a walk with Tammy and\\nour children, Mikhaila and Julian. I found it very difficult to remain\\npatient with them. I had too much work to do, always—or believed I\\ndid—and had disciplined myself through years of effort to focus\\ncontinually on that. If we went for a walk, I wanted to know exactly\\nwhere we were going, just how long it would take to get there, and\\nprecisely when we were going back. This is no attitude to adopt when\\ntrying to have a pleasant and reasonable time with toddlers. Not if\\nyou want to immerse yourself in the experience. Not if you want to\\nwatch and participate in the pleasure they take in their timeless\\n\\n\\x0cdiscovery. Not unless you want to risk missing something of crucial\\nimport.\\n\\nIt was very difficult for me to relax and focus on the present and\\n\\nwatch my little kids pursue their meandering route through the\\nneighborhood, with no particular destination, purpose, or schedule\\nin mind, engaging themselves deeply in an encounter with a local\\ndog, bug, or earthworm, or in some game they invented on the way.\\nNow and then, however, I could snap briefly into that same frame of\\nreference (that is one of the wonderful gifts provided by young\\nchildren) and see the pristine world they inhabited, still\\nuntrammeled by practiced and efficient memory, capable of\\nproducing pure joy in the newness of everything. But I was still\\npossessed enough by my future concerns to be involuntarily pulled\\nback into intense preoccupation with getting the next thing done.\\nI knew perfectly well that I was missing out on beauty and\\nmeaning and engagement, regardless of whatever advantages in\\nefficiency my impatience brought. I was narrow, sharp, and focused,\\nand did not waste time, but the price I paid for that was the\\nblindness demanded by efficiency, accomplishment, and order. I was\\nno longer seeing the world. I was seeing only the little I needed to\\nnavigate it with maximum speed and lowest cost. None of that was\\nsurprising. I had the responsibilities of an adult. I had a demanding\\njob. I had to take care of my family, and that meant sacrificing the\\npresent and attending to the future. But having little children around\\nand noticing their intense preoccupation with the present, and their\\nfascination with what was directly around them, made me very\\nconscious of the loss that accompanied maturity. Great poets are\\nexpressly aware of this, and they do what they can to remind the rest\\nof us:\\n\\nThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,\\nThe earth, and every common sight,\\nTo me did seem\\nApparelled in celestial light,\\nThe glory and the freshness of a dream.\\nIt is not now as it hath been of yore;—\\nTurn wheresoe’er I may,\\nBy night or day.\\n\\n\\x0cThe things which I have seen I now can see no more. . . .\\nYe blessèd creatures, I have heard the call\\nYe to each other make; I see\\nThe heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;\\nMy heart is at your festival,\\nMy head hath its coronal,\\nThe fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.\\nOh evil day! if I were sullen\\nWhile Earth herself is adorning,\\nThis sweet May-morning,\\nAnd the Children are culling\\nOn every side,\\nIn a thousand valleys far and wide,\\nFresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,\\nAnd the Babe leaps up on his Mother’s arm:—\\nI hear, I hear, with joy I hear!\\n—But there’s a Tree, of many, one,\\nA single field which I have looked upon,\\nBoth of them speak of something that is gone;\\nThe Pansy at my feet\\nDoth the same tale repeat:\\nWhither is fled the visionary gleam?\\nWhere is it now, the glory and the dream?\\n\\n—W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, “O\\x00\\x00: I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 R\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 E\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 C\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00”\\n\\nSome, in fact, never lose the glorious vision of childhood. This is\\n\\nparticularly true of artists (and, indeed, seems a vital part of what\\nmakes them artists). William Blake, the English painter, printmaker,\\nand poet, appears to have been one such person. He inhabited a\\nuniquely visionary world. Blake perceived something closer to what\\nthe philosopher Immanuel Kant termed “the thing in itself”1 than do\\nmost mortals, left as we are with the pale reflection of our\\nsurroundings that our increasingly restricted mature perceptions\\ndeliver to us. Blake was also exquisitely sensitive to the metaphoric\\nor dramatic significance of each apparently isolated event—the\\nmanner in which each event is rife with endless poetically echoing\\nconnotations:\\n\\n\\x0cEvery Farmer Understands\\nEvery Tear from Every Eye\\nBecomes a Babe in Eternity\\nThis is caught by Females bright\\nAnd returnd to its own delight\\nThe Bleat the Bark Bellow & Roar\\nAre Waves that Beat on Heavens Shore\\nThe Babe that weeps the Rod beneath\\nWrites Revenge in realms of Death\\nThe Beggars Rags fluttering in Air\\nDoes to Rags the Heavens tear\\nThe Soldier armd with Sword & Gun\\nPalsied strikes the Summers Sun\\nThe poor Mans Farthing is worth more\\nThan all the Gold on Africs Shore\\nOne Mite wrung from the Labrers hands\\nShall buy & sell the Misers Lands\\nOr if protected from on high\\nDoes that whole Nation sell & buy\\nHe who mocks the Infants Faith\\nShall be mockd in Age & Death\\nHe who shall teach the Child to Doubt\\nThe rotting Grave shall neer get out\\nHe who respects the Infants faith\\nTriumphs over Hell & Death\\n\\n—W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 B\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, “A\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00” (\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 67–90)\\n\\nThe vision of a true artist such as Blake is truly too much, because\\nwhat is beyond our memory-restricted perceptions is too much. It is\\nthe unfathomable totality of the world, past, present, and future\\nbound up together: every level connected to every other level,\\nnothing existing in isolation, everything implying something vital but\\nbeyond our comprehension, and all of it speaking of the\\noverwhelming mystery of Being. The visionary concentrates on\\nsomething we all see, hypothetically: a vase of flowers, perhaps, in all\\nits complexity and beauty, each bloom springing forth out of\\nnothingness, before its dissolution and return; a haystack in the\\nspring, and its appearance in the summer, autumn, and winter,\\n\\n\\x0cobserving and portraying the absolute mystery of its existence, with\\nits different shades of light and color, as well as the underlying\\ncommonality of form, which we can easily confuse with the full and\\nincomprehensible actuality of what is there.\\n\\nHow do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way, Is an\\nimmense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five?\\n\\n—W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 B\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 “A M\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 F\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00,” The Marriage\\n\\nof Heaven and Hell\\n\\nTo perceive Van Gogh’s painting Irises—from which the\\n\\nillustration that begins this chapter is derived—is, for example, to\\ngaze through a window back into the eternity that our perceptions\\nonce revealed, so that we can remember how awe inspiring and\\nmiraculous the world really is, under the mundane familiarity to\\nwhich we have reduced it. To share in the artist’s perception reunites\\nus with the source of inspiration that can rekindle our delight in the\\nworld, even if the drudgery and repetition of daily life has reduced\\nwhat we see to the narrowest and most pragmatic of visions.\\n\\nBut for those first affections,\\nThose shadowy recollections,\\nWhich, be they what they may\\nAre yet the fountain-light of all our day,\\nAre yet a master-light of all our seeing;\\nUphold us, cherish, and have power to make\\nOur noisy years seem moments in the being\\nOf the eternal Silence: truths that wake,\\nTo perish never;\\nWhich neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,\\nNor Man nor Boy,\\nNor all that is at enmity with joy,\\nCan utterly abolish or destroy!\\n\\n—W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, “O\\x00\\x00: I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 R\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 E\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 C\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00”\\n\\n\\x0cAll of this is very frightening. It is frightening to perceive the shells\\n\\nof ourselves that we have become. It is frightening to glimpse, even\\nfor a moment, the transcendent reality that exists beyond. We think\\nwe border our great paintings with luxurious, elaborate frames to\\nglorify them, but we do it at least as much to insist to ourselves that\\nthe glory of the painting itself ends at the frame. That bounding, that\\nbordering, leaves the world we are familiar with comfortably intact\\nand unchanged. We do not want that beauty reaching out past the\\nlimitations imposed on it and disturbing everything that is familiar.\\nWe do the same with museums, those asylums for genius: we\\n\\nisolate everything that is great—everything that could in principle be\\ndistributed throughout the world. Why cannot every small town have\\na shrine devoted to one great piece of art, instead of having every\\npiece collected in a manner impossible for anyone ever to take in at\\nonce? Is not one masterpiece enough for a room, or even for a\\nbuilding? Ten great works of art, or a hundred, in a single room is\\nabsurd, given that each is a world in and of itself. Such mass\\ncollection is a degrading of the unique singular particularity and\\nworth of what is priceless and irreplaceable. It is fear that entices us\\nto imprison art.

Then, outside of what anyone knows,\\nthere is the space of things that no one at all knows. Your world is\\nknown territory, surrounded by the relatively unknown, surrounded\\nby the absolutely unknown—surrounded, even more distantly, by the\\nabsolutely unknowable. Together, that is the canonical, archetypal\\nlandscape. The unknown manifests itself to you in the midst of the\\nknown. That revelation—sometimes exciting, but often quite painful\\n—is the source of new knowledge. But a fundamental question\\nremains: How is that knowledge generated? What is comprehended\\nand understandable does not just leap in one fell swoop from the\\nabsolutely unknown to the thoroughly and self-evidently articulated.\\nKnowledge must pass through many stages of analysis—a multitude\\nof transformations—before it becomes, let us say, commonplace.\\nThe first stage is that of pure action—reflex action, at the most\\nbasic of levels.2 If something surprises you, you react to it first with\\nyour body. You crouch defensively, or freeze, or run away in panic.\\nThose are all forms of representation and categorization, in nascent\\nform. Crouch means predatory attack. Freeze means predatory\\nthreat. Panic means terror necessitating escape. The world of\\npossibility begins to actualize itself with such instinctual, embodied\\naction, unconscious and uncontrollable. The first realization of\\npossibility, of potential, is not conceptual. It is embodied, but it is\\nstill representational. (It is no longer the thing in itself we referred to\\n\\n\\x0cearlier, but the transmutation of that thing into a commensurate\\nphysical response. That is a representation.)\\n\\nMaybe you are at home, at night. Assume you are alone. It is dark\\n\\nand late. An unexpected noise startles you, and you freeze. That is\\nthe first transmutation: unknown noise (a pattern) to frozen\\nposition. Then your heart rate rises, in preparation for (unspecified)\\naction.3 That is the second transmutation. You are preparing to\\nmove. Next, your imagination populates the darkness with whatever\\nmight be making the noise.4 That is the third transmutation, part of a\\ncomplete and practical sequence: embodied responses (freezing and\\nheart-rate increase) and then imagistic, imaginative representation.\\nThe latter is part of exploration, which you might extend by\\novercoming your terror and the freezing associated with it (assuming\\nnothing else too unexpected happens) and investigating the locale,\\nonce a part of your friendly house, from where the noise appeared to\\nemanate. You have now engaged in active exploration—a precursor\\nto direct perception (hopefully nothing too dramatic); then to explicit\\nknowledge of the source; and then back to routine and complacent\\npeace, if the noise proves to be nothing of significance. That is how\\ninformation moves from the unknown to the known. (Except that\\nsometimes the noise does not prove insignificant. Then there is\\ntrouble.)\\n\\nArtists are the people who stand on the frontier of the\\n\\ntransformation of the unknown into knowledge. They make their\\nvoluntary foray out into the unknown, and they take a piece of it and\\ntransform it into an image. Maybe they do it through choreography\\nand dance—by representing the manifestation of the world in\\nphysical display, communicable, although not in words, to others.\\nMaybe they do it by acting, which is a sophisticated form of\\nembodiment and imitation, or by painting or sculpting. Perhaps they\\nmanage it through screenwriting, or by penning a novel. After all that\\ncome the intellectuals, with philosophy and criticism, abstracting\\nand articulating the work’s representations and rules.\\n\\nConsider the role that creative people play in cities. They are\\n\\ntypically starving a bit, because it is virtually impossible to be\\ncommercially successful as an artist, and that hunger is partly what\\nmotivates them (do not underestimate the utility of necessity). In\\ntheir poverty, they explore the city, and they discover some ratty,\\nquasi-criminal area that has seen better days. They visit, look, and\\n\\n\\x0cpoke about, and they think, “You know, with a little work, this area\\ncould be cool.” Then they move in, piece together some galleries, and\\nput up some art. They do not make any money, but they civilize the\\nspace a bit. In doing so, they elevate and transform what is too\\ndangerous into something cutting edge. Then a coffee shop pops up,\\nand maybe an unconventional clothing store. The next thing you\\nknow, the gentrifiers move in. They are creative types, too, but more\\nconservative (less desperate, perhaps; more risk averse, at least—so\\nthey are not the first ones on the edge of the frontier). Then the\\ndevelopers show up. And then the chain stores appear, and the\\nmiddle or upper class establishes itself. Then the artists have to\\nmove, because they can no longer afford the rent. That is a loss for\\nthe avant-garde, but it is okay, even though it is harsh, because with\\nall that stability and predictability the artists should not be there\\nanymore. They need to rejuvenate some other area. They need\\nanother vista to conquer. That is their natural environment.\\n\\nThat edge, where artists are always transforming chaos into order,\\n\\ncan be a very rough and dangerous place. Living there, an artist\\nconstantly risks falling fully into the chaos, instead of transforming\\nit. But artists have always lived there, on the border of human\\nunderstanding. Art bears the same relationship to society that the\\ndream bears to mental life. You are very creative when you are\\ndreaming. That is why, when you remember a dream, you think,\\n“Where in the world did that come from?” It is very strange and\\nincomprehensible that something can happen in your head, and you\\nhave no idea how it got there or what it means. It is a miracle:\\nnature’s voice manifesting itself in your psyche. And it happens every\\nnight. Like art, the dream mediates between order and chaos. So, it is\\nhalf chaos. That is why it is not comprehensible. It is a vision, not a\\nfully fledged articulated production. Those who actualize those half-\\nborn visions into artistic productions are those who begin to\\ntransform what we do not understand into what we can at least start\\nto see. That is the role of the artist, occupying the vanguard. That is\\ntheir biological niche. They are the initial civilizing agents.\\n\\nThe artists do not understand full well what they are doing. They\\ncannot, if they are doing something genuinely new. Otherwise, they\\ncould just say what they mean and have done with it. They would not\\nrequire expression in dance, music, and image. But they are guided\\nby feel, by intuition—by their facility with the detection of patterns—\\n\\n\\x0cand that is all embodied, rather than articulated, at least in its initial\\nstages. When creating, the artists are struggling, contending, and\\nwrestling with a problem—maybe even a problem they do not fully\\nunderstand—and striving to bring something new into clear focus.\\nOtherwise they are mere propagandists, reversing the artistic\\nprocess, attempting to transform something they can already\\narticulate into image and art for the purpose of rhetorical and\\nideological victory. That is a great sin, harnessing the higher for the\\npurposes of the lower. It is a totalitarian tactic, the subordination of\\nart and literature to politics (or the purposeful blurring of the\\ndistinction between them).\\n\\nArtists must be contending with something they do not\\n\\nunderstand, or they are not artists. Instead, they are posers, or\\nromantics (often romantic failures), or narcissists, or actors (and not\\nin the creative sense). They are likely, when genuine, to be\\nidiosyncratically and peculiarly obsessed by their intuition—\\npossessed by it, willing to pursue it even in the face of opposition and\\nthe overwhelming likelihood of rejection, criticism, and practical and\\nfinancial failure. When they are successful they make the world more\\nunderstandable (sometimes replacing something more “understood,”\\nbut now anachronistic, with something new and better). They move\\nthe unknown closer to the conscious, social, and articulated world.\\nAnd then people gaze at those artworks, watch the dramas, and listen\\nto the stories, and they start to become informed by them, but they\\ndo not know how or why. And people find great value in it—more\\nvalue, perhaps, than in anything else. There is good reason that the\\nmost expensive artifacts in the world—those that are literally, or\\nclose to literally, priceless—are great works of art.\\n\\nI once visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It\\ncontained a collection of great and famous Renaissance paintings—\\neach worth hundreds of millions of dollars, assuming they were ever\\nmade available for purchase. The area containing them was a shrine,\\na place of the divine—for believers and atheists alike. It was in the\\nmost expensive and prestigious of museums, located on real estate of\\nthe highest quality and desirability, in what might well be the most\\nactive and exciting city in the world. The collection had been put\\ntogether over a great expanse of time, and with much difficulty. The\\ngallery was packed with people, many of whom had voyaged there as\\npart of what must be most properly regarded as a pilgrimage.\\n\\n\\x0cI asked myself, “What are these people up to, coming to this place,\\nso carefully curated, traveling these great distances, looking at these\\npaintings? And what do they believe they are up to?” One painting\\nfeatured the Immaculate Conception of Mary, brilliantly composed.\\nThe Mother of God was rising to heaven, in a beatific state,\\nencapsulated in a mandorla of clouds, embedded with the faces of\\nputti. Many of the people gathered were gazing, enraptured, at the\\nwork. I thought, “They do not know what that painting means. They\\ndo not understand the symbolic meaning of the mandorla, or the\\nsignificance of the putti, or the idea of the glorification of the Mother\\nof God. And God, after all, is dead—or, so goes the story. Why does\\nthe painting nonetheless retain its value? Why is it in this room, in\\nthis building, with these other paintings, in this city—carefully\\nguarded, not to be touched? Why is this painting—and all these\\nothers—beyond price and desired by those who already have\\neverything? Why are these creations stored so carefully in a modern\\nshrine, and visited by people from all over the world, as if it were a\\nduty—even as if it were desirable or necessary?”\\n\\nWe treat these objects as if they are sacred. At least that is what\\nour actions in their vicinity suggest. We gaze at them in ignorance\\nand wonder, and remember what we have forgotten; perceiving, ever\\nso dimly, what we can no longer see (what we are perhaps no longer\\nwilling to see). The unknown shines through the productions of great\\nartists in partially articulated form. The awe-inspiring ineffable\\nbegins to be realized but retains a terrifying abundance of its\\ntranscendent power. That is the role of art, and that is the role of\\nartists. It is no wonder we keep their dangerous, magical productions\\nlocked up, framed, and apart from everything else. And if a great\\npiece is damaged anywhere, the news spreads worldwide. We feel a\\ntremor run through the bedrock of our culture. The dream upon\\nwhich our reality depends shakes and moves. We find ourselves\\nunnerved.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI live with my wife in a small semidetached house, with a living room\\nthat cannot be larger than 12’ x 12’. But we worked to make that\\nroom extremely beautiful, while endeavoring to do the same with the\\n\\n\\x0crest of the house. In the living room hung some large paintings (not\\nto everyone’s taste, certainly: they were Soviet realist/impressionist\\npieces, some illustrating the Second World War, some representing\\nthe triumph of communism), as well as a variety of cubist miniatures\\nand South American pieces heavily influenced by the native\\ntradition. Prior to our recent renovations the room had held at least\\ntwenty-five paintings, including about fifteen smaller pieces (12” x\\n12”). There was even one—reminiscent of a medieval etching,\\nalthough painted on canvas—on the ceiling, where I had attached it\\nwith magnets. It was from a Romanian church. The largest was 6’\\nhigh and about 8’ wide. (I know perfectly well that aggregating all\\nthese paintings together in such a small space contradicts my earlier\\npoint about devoting a room or even a building to a single work of\\nart, but I have only a single house, so I plead necessity: If I wanted to\\ncollect paintings, they had to be put where I was able to put them.) In\\nthe rest of the house, we used thirty-six different colors, and a variety\\nof different glosses on the walls and the trim throughout the building\\n—all from a palette that matched a large realist painting of a railway\\nyard in Chicago in the 1950s, created by the same artist who helped\\nus plan and then renovate our home.\\n\\nI bought the Soviet pieces on eBay from Ukrainian junk dealers\\nspecializing in Soviet-era artifacts. At one point, I had a network of\\nabout twenty people in the Ukraine sending me photographs of\\nwhatever paintings they had scrounged from the ruins of the Soviet\\nbureaucracy. Most were awful. But some were amazing. I have a\\ngreat painting, for example, of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space,\\nstanding in front of a rocket and a radar installation, and another\\nfrom the 1970s of a lonesome soldier writing his mother in front of a\\nlarge radio. It is really something to see relatively modern events\\nmemorialized in oil by talented artists. (The Soviets kept their\\nacademies functioning continuously from the nineteenth century\\nonward and, although tremendous restrictions were placed on what\\ncould be produced, those who passed through them became highly\\nskilled painters.)\\n\\nThe Soviet paintings eventually took over our house. Most of them\\n\\nwere small and insanely inexpensive, and I bought dozens of them.\\nThe Soviet era produced its own impressionism, often depicting\\nlandscapes, rougher and harsher than the classic French versions but\\nmuch to my taste and reminiscent of where I grew up in western\\n\\n\\x0cCanada. While seeking them out, I exposed myself to a larger\\nnumber of paintings, I like to think, than anyone else in history. For\\nat least four years, starting in 2001, I searched eBay, looking at\\nroughly a thousand paintings a day,* seeking the one or two in that\\nnumber that were of genuine quality. It was most often a Russian or\\nSoviet landscape selling for a song—better paintings than I had ever\\nseen in galleries or museum collections in Toronto. I would place\\nthem in a list of items I was interested in—an eBay feature—print\\nthem out, lay them on the floor, and then ask my wife, Tammy, to\\nhelp me narrow my choices. She has a good eye and a fair bit of\\ntraining as an artist. We would discard anything we found to be\\nflawed and purchase what remained. Because of this, my kids grew\\nup surrounded by art, and it certainly left an impression. Many of my\\npaintings now hang in their respective dwellings. (They tended to\\navoid the more political Soviet propaganda, which I was interested in\\nbecause of its historical significance and because of the ongoing war\\non the canvases between art—a consequence of the painter’s\\nundeniable talent—and the propaganda that art was doomed to\\nserve. I can tell you that the art shines through the propaganda as the\\nyears pass by. That is something very interesting to observe.)\\nI also tried, at about that time, to make my university office\\nbeautiful. After I was transferred from an office I had already put\\nsome work into, the same artist who helped redesign the interior of\\nour house (and from whom I also purchased many large paintings,\\nwhich also hang in our house) tried to help me transform my new\\nfactory-like, fluorescent-lit catastrophe of a 1970s sealed-windows\\nhellhole office into something that someone with some sense could\\nsit in for thirty years without wanting to die. Faculty members were\\nforbidden to undertake any major modifications to these spaces, due\\nto union requirements (or administration interpretations of those\\nrequirements). So, my artist friend and I devised an alternate plan.\\nWe decided to insert some heavy, nickel-plated hooks into the\\ncinderblock, in pairs about four feet apart and seven feet above the\\nground, and then to hang from those hooks good three-quarter-inch\\nsanded and stained wood sheets with cherry veneer on one side.\\nVoila: wood-paneled office, for the cost of about eight seventy-five-\\ndollar pieces of plywood, plus some labor. We were going to install\\nthese on a weekend, when there was no one else around. Then we\\nplanned to paint the drop ceilings (carefully, as asbestos lurked\\n\\n\\x0cabove the tiles). Hell is a place of drop ceilings, rusted ventilation\\ngrates, and fluorescent lights; the dismal ugliness and dreariness and\\ngeneral depression of spirit that results from these cost-saving\\nfeatures no doubt suppresses productivity far more than the cheapest\\nof architectural tricks and the most deadening of lights saves money.\\nEveryone looks like a corpse under fluorescents. Penny-wise and\\npound-foolish indeed.\\n\\nWe were going to paint the ceiling with a paint called Hammerite,\\n\\nwhich looks like beaten metal once it dries. That would have\\ntransformed the unavoidable industrial aesthetic, which can be\\nattractive if handled wisely, into something thoughtful and unique.\\nThis could also have been done for minimal cost. A good carpet,\\nperhaps Persian (also very inexpensive on eBay), some reasonably\\nhigh-quality curtains, and a decent industrial desk: one weekend of\\nsecretive work, and an office that a civilized person could inhabit\\nwithout resentment and self-contempt.\\n\\nBut I made a fatal error. I spoke to one of the senior\\n\\nadministrators of the psychology department about my plans. She\\nand I had previously discussed the sheer ugliness of the floor our\\narea inhabited and the dismal state of all the offices, and I thought\\nwe had established consensus that improvement was warranted. I\\nassumed she was on board. We had even talked about transforming\\nher corner office. I began to excitedly share my intentions. She\\nlooked displeased instead of happy, and said unexpectedly, “You\\ncannot do that.” I shook my head in disbelief and thought: “What? I\\nam planning to make something exceedingly ugly better, quickly,\\nwith no trouble, for no money to speak of—and your response is,\\n‘You cannot do that!?’” I said, “What do you mean?” She said, “Well,\\nif you do it, everyone else will want to do it.” Four responses flashed\\nthrough my mind: One: “No, they would not.” Two: “Everyone could\\ndo it, because it would be dirt cheap.” Three: “I thought we were sane\\nadults, having a productive conversation about improving something\\nimportant in a university, but we are actually children squabbling in\\na kindergarten playground.” Four: “I thought I was speaking with\\nsomeone sane and reasonable, but I was clearly wrong.” She finished\\nthe conversation with a direct threat: “Do not push me on this.”\\nStupid me. I asked for permission. (Not really: I was trying to\\ncommunicate something motivating, beautiful, and exciting. But it\\nboiled down to a power game.) I shared none of my four responses,\\n\\n\\x0chowever—although I was sorely tempted to voice all of them—and\\nimmediately recalibrated my strategy.\\n\\nMy artist friend and I were already more than conversant with the\\n\\nessential insanity and intransigence of mid-level bureaucracies, so\\nwe had already dreamed up a less expansive plan B. This involved\\nthe careful choosing of paint for the walls (rather than the much\\npreferable wood), with some accent painting where that was\\npossible, and matching carpets and drapery. I still had to fight the\\nadministration to get the precise colors I had chosen (which suited\\nthe industrial feel of the office), but won that battle. Plan B was not\\nas good as plan A, but it was still much better than the status quo.\\nLater, I added a dropped copper ceiling, using lightweight adhesive\\nplastic tiles that mimic decorative metal quite accurately, hung a few\\npaintings, and added a couple of suitable statues. Students,\\ncolleagues, and visitors come in and do a double take. My office is a\\nplace of creativity and beauty, and not a bloody horrible fluorescent-\\nlit factory. Visitors are surprised, therefore—surprised, relieved, and\\npleased.\\n\\nNot long after, I discovered that the department was now bringing\\npotential new hires into my office to show them what kind of creative\\nfreedom was possible at the University of Toronto. I thought that was\\ninsanely comical. I thought about all of that for a long time. The\\nresistance I encountered was somewhat incomprehensible in its\\nstrength. I wondered, “God, people seem to be afraid of what I am\\ndoing in this office. Perhaps there is a reason—an important reason—\\nI do not understand.” Then I came across a story by the biologist\\nRobert Sapolsky. It was about wildebeest.5 Wildebeest are herd\\nanimals and very difficult to distinguish from one another (maybe\\nnot for other wildebeest, but certainly for those who wish to study\\nthem). They blend together. At one point in the past, this presented a\\nserious problem to biologists needing to observe individual animals\\nfor enough time to derive some conclusions about their behavior.\\nThey would watch a wildebeest, look away for a moment to make\\nnotes, and be unable to locate the same animal when they glanced\\nback up.\\n\\nEventually, they settled on a potential solution. The biologists\\ndrove up adjacent to the herd in a Jeep, armed with a bucket of red\\npaint and a stick with a rag on it. They dabbed a red spot on one of\\nthe wildebeest’s haunches. Now they could track the activities of that\\n\\n\\x0cparticular animal, and hopefully learn something new about\\nwildebeest behavior. But guess what happened to the wildebeest,\\nnow differentiated from the herd? The predators, always lurking\\naround the herd, took it down. Lions—a major wildebeest threat—\\ncannot easily bring a single wildebeest down unless they can identify\\nit. They cannot hunt a blur of indistinguishable herd animals. They\\ncannot track down four wildebeest at a time. They must organize\\ntheir hunt around an identifiable individual. Thus, when lions go\\nafter the little ones or the ones that limp, they are not culling the\\nweak, in some natural display of beneficial altruism. They would\\nrather dine on a nice, healthy, delicious, juicy wildebeest than one\\nthat is tiny, old, or ill. But they must be able to identify their prey.\\nWhat is the moral of the story? Make yourself colorful, stand out,\\nand the lions will take you down. And the lions are always there.\\n\\nIf you stick your neck out, then the sword will come. Many, many\\n\\ncultures have a saying like that. The English version? “The poppy\\nthat grows higher than the rest is the first one to have its head\\nremoved by the scythe.” In Japan: “The nail that sticks up above the\\nrest is the first to get hit by the hammer.” This is a nontrivial\\nobservation: hence its commonality. Artistic, creative endeavor is\\nhigh risk, while the probability of return is low. But the probability of\\nexceptionally high return does exist, and creative endeavor, while\\ndangerous and unlikely to be successful, is also absolutely vital to the\\ntransformation that enables us to keep our footing. Everything\\nchanges. Pure traditionalism is doomed for that very reason. We\\nneed the new, merely to maintain our position. And we need to see\\nwhat we have become blinded to, by our very expertise and\\nspecialization, so that we do not lose touch with the Kingdom of God\\nand die in our boredom, ennui, arrogance, blindness to beauty, and\\nsoul-deadening cynicism. Plus, are we helpless prey animals,\\ncowering and protecting ourselves, hiding and camouflaging, or are\\nwe human beings?\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nPeople are often upset by abstract art, or by art that appears to\\ndevote itself to producing negative reactions such as disgust or\\nhorror merely for the shock value. I have a tremendous respect for\\n\\n\\x0cideals of traditional beauty and, therefore, some sympathy for that\\nresponse, and there is little doubt that many who merely disdain\\ntradition mask the sentiment with artistic pretension. However, the\\npassage of time differentiates truly inspired work from the\\nfraudulent sort, even if imperfectly, and what is not crucial is\\ngenerally left behind. It is easy to make the opposite error, as well:\\nthat art should be pretty and easily appreciated, without work or\\nchallenge: it should be decorative; it should match the living-room\\nfurniture. But art is not decoration. That is the attitude of a naive\\nbeginner, or of someone who will not let their terror of art allow\\nthem to progress and learn.\\n\\nArt is exploration. Artists train people to see. Most people with\\nany exposure to art now regard the work of the impressionists, for\\nexample, as both self-evidently beautiful and relatively traditional.\\nThis is in no small part because we all perceive the world now, at\\nleast in part, in the manner that only impressionists could manage in\\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century. We cannot help doing so,\\nbecause the impressionist aesthetic has saturated everything:\\nadvertisements, movies, popular posters, comic books, photographs\\n—all forms of visual art. Now we all see the beauty of light that only\\nthe impressionists could once apprehend. They taught us this. But\\nwhen the impressionists first displayed their paintings—in the Salon\\ndes Refusés of 1863, as the traditional Paris Salon had rejected them\\n—the pieces were met with laughter and contempt. The idea of\\nperceiving that way (paying particular attention to light, essentially,\\nrather than form) was so radical that it caused people to have\\nemotional fits.\\n\\nI am often struck by how common even the tropes of cubism,\\nmuch more extreme and strange in some ways than impressionism,\\nhave become part and parcel of our visual vernacular. I have seen the\\nmultidimensional but flattened faces of the genre even in comic\\nbooks. The same is true of surrealism, which has become popularly\\nintegrated almost to the point of cliché. It is worth repeating: Artists\\nteach people to see. It is very hard to perceive the world, and we are\\nso fortunate to have geniuses to teach us how to do it, to reconnect us\\nwith what we have lost, and to enlighten us to the world. It is for such\\npsychological reasons that lines such as Christ’s can be profitably\\nconsidered:\\n\\n\\x0cAt that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who,\\nthen, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”\\n\\nHe called a little child to him, and placed the child\\n\\namong them.\\n\\nAnd he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and\\n\\nbecome like little children, you will never enter the\\nkingdom of heaven. (Matthew 18:1–3)\\n\\nBeauty leads you back to what you have lost. Beauty reminds you\\n\\nof what remains forever immune to cynicism. Beauty beckons in a\\nmanner that straightens your aim. Beauty reminds you that there is\\nlesser and greater value. Many things make life worth living: love,\\nplay, courage, gratitude, work, friendship, truth, grace, hope, virtue,\\nand responsibility. But beauty is among the greatest of these.\\n\\nWhat though the radiance which was once so bright\\nBe now for ever taken from my sight,\\nThough nothing can bring back the hour\\nOf splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;\\nWe will grieve not, rather find\\nStrength in what remains behind;\\nIn the primal sympathy\\nWhich having been must ever be;\\nIn the soothing thoughts that spring\\nOut of human suffering;\\nIn the faith that looks through death,\\nIn years that bring the philosophic mind.\\n\\n—W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 W\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, “O\\x00\\x00: I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 I\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 R\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 E\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 C\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00”\\n\\nTry to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nIF OLD MEMORIES STILL UPSET YOU, WRITE THEM\\nDOWN CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nImagine you undertook some truly terrible actions in the past. You\\nbetrayed or hurt people in a genuinely damaging manner. You\\ndamaged their reputation with gossip and innuendo. You took credit\\nfor their work. You robbed them materially or spiritually. You\\ncheated on them. Or imagine, instead, that you have been the target\\nof some such events—and let us also assume you have become wise\\nenough to try to avoid repeating the experience. In both\\ncircumstances (as perpetrator or victim) the actual events and the\\nassociated memories evoke fear, guilt, and shame. Why?\\n\\nIn the first case, you have betrayed yourself. You did not play the\\n\\nmedium- to long-term game properly, and are suffering the\\nconsequences. You are not the sort of person other people choose to\\nhave around. You might not even be the sort of person you want to\\nhave around. In the second case, you were badly mistreated by\\nsomeone else. In some real sense, however, it does not matter\\nwhether you were suffering because of self-betrayal or at the hands\\nof others. What does matter is that you do not desire any recurrence.\\n\\nNow, if you recall the memory, or if it comes back unbidden,\\n\\ncomplete with terror, shame, and guilt, this means something\\nspecific. It means that you fell into a hole—a pit, more accurately—or\\nwere pushed there. And that is not good. But what is worse is that\\nyou do not know why. Perhaps you trusted other people too easily.\\nPerhaps you were too naive. Perhaps you were willfully blind.\\nPerhaps you encountered genuine malevolence, on the part of\\n\\n\\x0canother or yourself (and that is the worst situation, and the one most\\ndifficult to overcome). But at one level of analysis, whether you fell or\\nwere pushed makes little difference—not to the emotional systems\\nthat have emerged over the course of evolution and now serve to\\nprotect you. They care about one thing and one thing only: that you\\ndo not repeat a mistake.\\n\\nThe alarms those systems activate are fear-based (that is too weak\\na phrase—terror-based is more accurate, the kind of terror limited to\\nneither time nor place), and all they care about is reminding you of\\nthe still-extant danger. A part of reality, and a perilous part, has\\nremained unmapped, low resolution, lacking sufficient detail—and so\\nhas a part of you. You are not sharp, alert, dangerous, wary, wise, or\\nkind enough—who knows?—so that the terror systems protecting you\\nare confident in your ability to wend your way successfully through\\nthe same maze if it once again manifests itself in front of you.\\nLearn from the past. Or repeat its horrors, in imagination,\\n\\nendlessly.\\n\\nFrequently, people do not so much repress the terrible things that\\nhappened in the past as refuse to think them through, pushing them\\nout of their mind or occupying themselves with other activities. They\\nhave their reasons. And sometimes traumatized people appear\\nliterally unable to understand what befell them. It can be\\nprohibitively difficult for abused children, for example, to generate a\\nworldview philosophically sophisticated enough to span the full\\nspectrum of human motivation. They simply cannot understand why\\nsomeone might torment them physically or abuse them sexually. If\\nthey are young enough, it is likely that they do not even explicitly\\ncomprehend what is happening. Comprehending such matters is\\nexceptionally challenging, even for adults. But in some unfortunate\\nand arguably unjust sense, it does not matter. Refusal or inability\\nboth leave a geographic area in memory—unexplored, active, and rife\\nwith danger. It is a psychological truism that anything sufficiently\\nthreatening or harmful once encountered can never be forgotten if it\\nhas never been understood.1\\n\\nTo orient ourselves in the world, we need to know where we are\\nand where we are going. Where we are: that concept must optimally\\ninclude a full account of our experience of the world to date. If you do\\nnot know what roads you have traversed, it is difficult to calculate\\nwhere you are. Where we are going: that is the projection of our\\n\\n\\x0cultimate ideal—by no means simply a question, say, of\\naccomplishment, love, wealth, or power, but development of the\\ncharacter that makes all fortunate outcomes more likely and all\\nunfortunate outcomes less likely. We map the world so that we can\\nmake the move from where we are—from point A—to where we are\\ngoing—to point B. We use our map to guide our movement, and we\\nencounter successes and obstacles along the way.\\n\\nThe successes are both confidence building and exhilarating. Not\\n\\nonly are we moving toward our ultimate desire, we appear to be\\ndoing so properly (and are therefore not only moving ahead but\\nvalidating our map). The obstacles and failures are, by contrast,\\nanxiety provoking, depressing, and painful. They indicate our\\nprofound ignorance. They indicate that we do not understand with\\nsufficient depth where we have been, where we are, or where we are\\ngoing. They indicate that something we have built with great\\ndifficulty and wish above all to protect is flawed—to a degree both\\nserious and not fully understood.\\n\\nWe must recollect our experiences and derive from them their\\nmoral. Otherwise, we remain in the past, plagued by reminiscences,\\ntormented by conscience, cynical for the loss of what might have\\nbeen, unforgiving of ourselves, and unable to accept the challenges\\nand tragedies facing us. We must recollect ourselves or suffer in\\ndirect proportion to our ignorance and avoidance. We must gather\\neverything from the past that we avoided. We must rekindle every\\nlost opportunity. We must repent for missing the mark, meditate on\\nour errors, acquire now what we should have acquired then, and put\\nourselves back together. And I am not saying this is always possible.\\nI have seen people so lost that there was not enough spark left to\\nsurvive. The person in the present had been rendered too\\ninsignificant to confront, in his or her current condition, what was\\navoided even by a once-healthier self in the past. And cynicism about\\nthe future rationalizes the avoidance and deception. That is hell, and\\nthere is no limit to its depth. The humility required to clamber out of\\nsuch hell exists in precise proportion to the magnitude of the\\nunrequited errors of the past. And that is enough to send a shudder\\nof true terror down the spine of anyone even partly awakened. We\\nare not allowed, it seems, to avoid the responsibility of actualizing\\npotential. And if we have made a mistake in the past, and left what\\ncould be unmanifest—regardless of the reason—then we pay the\\n\\n\\x0cprice for that in the inability to forget, and in the emotion that\\nconstitutes the pangs of conscience for past misbehavior.\\n\\nImagine that when you are very young, the map of the world you\\nuse to guide your immature self is correspondingly underdeveloped,\\nlike a child’s drawing of a house: always straight and centered,\\nportraying only the front; always (or close enough) with a door and\\ntwo windows; always with a square for the outside wall and a triangle\\nfor the roof; always with a chimney and smoke (which is a surprise,\\nbecause smoking chimneys are not all that common now). The sun is\\nshining irrepressibly—a circle with rays emanating from it. There are\\na few flowers—single lines with the schematic of a bloom at the top,\\nand two leaves halfway up the “stems.” It is a very low-resolution\\nrepresentation of a house. It is more hieroglyph than drawing; more\\nconcept than sketch. It is something that represents the idea of\\nhouse, or perhaps home, generically, like the words “house” or\\n“home” themselves. However, it is almost always enough: The child\\nwho drew the picture knows it is a house, and the other children and\\nthe adults who see the picture know it is a house. The drawing does\\nthe trick. It fulfills its purpose. It is a good-enough map.\\n\\nBut all too often appalling events occur within houses. These are\\nnot so easy to represent. Maybe the house has adults in it—parents,\\ngrandparents, uncles, or aunts—who say such things as “Never—and\\nI mean never—speak to anyone about what happens here.” A few\\nsquares, a triangle, a smattering of flowers, and a benevolent solar\\norb offer only an inadequate representation of the horrors\\ncharacterizing such a dwelling place. Maybe what is happening\\ninside the house is beyond both tolerability and understanding. But\\nhow can what is terrifying be beyond understanding? How can\\ntrauma even exist without comprehension? Is not understanding in\\nsome sense a prerequisite to experience itself? These are all great\\nmysteries. But everything is not experienced at the same level of\\nconception. We have all been petrified by the unknown, even though\\nthat seems a contradiction in terms. But the body knows what the\\nmind does not yet grasp. And it remembers. And it demands that\\nunderstanding be established. And there is simply no escaping that\\ndemand. If something befalls us—or, perhaps worse, we engage in\\nsome act—that freezes us in terror and nauseates us to recall, we are\\nbound by implacable fate to transform raw horror into\\nunderstanding, or suffer the consequences.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI had a client who began speaking to me almost immediately after we\\nmet of the sexual abuse she suffered in childhood at the hands of of\\nan older cousin, with whom she lived. She became markedly tearful\\nand upset when she recounted her experiences. I asked her how old\\nshe was when the abuse occurred. She told me she was four. She\\ndescribed her attacker as much larger, stronger, and older than her. I\\nallowed my imagination to roam freely as she spoke, making the\\nassumptions I believed (or my fantasy presumed) were justified by\\nthe nature of her description. I envisioned the nefarious, sadistic,\\nand criminal machinations of a late adolescent or young adult. Then\\nI asked her how much difference in age there was between her and\\nher victimizer. She replied, “Two years. He was two years older than\\nme.” This came as a genuine surprise. It changed the picture in my\\nmind almost completely.\\n\\nI told her what I had been imagining, because I wanted her to\\nknow what assumptions I had been formulating as she related her\\nstory. Then I said, “You know, you are all grown up now, and have\\nbeen for a long time. But you told me your story in the same way that\\nyou might have told it when you were four, when the molestation was\\nstill occurring—or at least with many of the same emotions. And\\nthere is no doubt that you remember your cousin as much larger and\\nstronger and older than you. A six-year-old is, after all, half again as\\nold as a four-year-old, and from that younger child’s perspective,\\nperhaps more akin to an adult. But your cousin was six—almost as\\nmuch a child as you. So, here is another way you might consider\\nthinking about what happened. First, recall the six-year-olds with\\nwhom you are now familiar. You know that they are still immature\\nand cannot be held accountable as adults might be for their actions,\\neven though they might also not be altogether innocent. I am not\\ntrying to minimize the seriousness of what happened to you, and I\\nam not questioning the intensity of your emotions. But I am asking\\nyou to consider the situation as if you became aware of its occurrence\\namong two children you presently know. Kids are curious. They play\\ndoctor. And if the adults around them are not paying attention\\nproperly, such games can get out of hand. Would it be possible to\\nconsider that you were not molested by an overpowering and\\nmalevolent force—the way you might be if you were raped now?\\n\\n\\x0cMaybe, instead, you and your cousin were very poorly supervised\\nchildren.”\\n\\nIn some important way, the memories she retained of her\\n\\nchildhood experiences had not altered as she matured. She was still\\nexperiencing the terror of a four-year-old, helpless in the hands of\\nsomeone old enough to be perceived as grown-up. But her twenty-\\nseven-year-old self needed to update that memory. She was no\\nlonger at risk for such treatment, in any obvious manner. And it\\ncame as a great relief to her to reframe what had happened. She\\ncould now consider it as a potential consequence of curiosity\\nuntrammeled by adult attention. This shifted her view of her cousin,\\nthe situation, and herself. She could now see the event from the\\nperspective of an adult. This freed her from much of the terror and\\nshame still associated with the memories, and it did so with\\nremarkable rapidity. She confronted the horrors of the past\\nvoluntarily, finding a causal explanation that was much less\\ntraumatic—lacking, as it did, the vision of her cousin as a malevolent,\\npowerful perpetrator and her as the inevitably hapless victim of such\\na force. All this transformation occurred in a single session. Such can\\nbe the power of the story surrounding the terrible events of our\\npasts.\\n\\nThis experience left me with a profound philosophical quandary.\\n\\nThe memories my client brought into my office had remained\\nunchanged for decades. The memories she walked out with were\\nmarkedly altered. Which, then, were real? It could easily be argued\\nthat her original story was more accurate. It was, after all, as direct\\nan imprint as might be left on the open book of a four-year-old’s\\nmind. It had not been altered (and therefore changed) by any\\nprevious therapeutic intervention. Was it not, then, the genuine\\narticle? But it is also the case that an event that means one thing one\\nday might come to mean something quite different another. Is it so\\nunusual for us to better understand what motivated the otherwise\\ninexplicable behavior of our parents, for example, as we ourselves\\nenter parenthood? And which memory is more accurate: the partial\\npicture of adult motivation we have as children, or the revised\\nrecollections made possible by maturity? If it is the latter—and that\\ndoes not seem unreasonable (and certainly seemed true in the case of\\nmy client)—how is it that an altered memory can become more\\naccurate than one retaining its original configuration?\\n\\n\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI recall another client who remembered, in a striking sense, and\\nchanged. His memories were shrouded much more profoundly in\\nmystery, and his remembrance was of a slower, more surprising, and\\nunlikelier sort. He was a young, gay African American man who was\\nsuffering from a set of incomprehensible mental and physical\\nsymptoms. A psychiatrist had recently diagnosed him with\\nschizophrenia, but his aunt, who had taken him to the hospital for\\nevaluation, believed that insufficient time had been spent on her\\nnephew’s evaluation. She contacted me for a second opinion and\\nbrought him to my office. I saw him alone.\\n\\nHe was shy and reserved, but neatly and carefully dressed, and\\n\\nappeared fully oriented when I started to gather his history.\\nFurthermore, he wore eyeglasses—and they were well taken care of,\\nlacking tape on the bridge or arms, and with lenses that were\\nperfectly clean. These observations were all relevant, as far as I was\\nconcerned. Schizophrenics lose the ability to monitor themselves\\neffectively, so unkempt clothing and damaged eyeglasses—\\nparticularly with badly smudged lenses—are telling features (not\\ninvariably: so those of you with subpar eyewear are not required to\\nconsider yourself classified). In any case, he also had a full-time job\\nof reasonable complexity (another rarity for someone with\\nschizophrenia), and he could carry on a conversation with no\\nproblem, apart from his tendency toward shyness. I accepted him as\\na client, and we began to meet regularly.\\n\\nI had to see him a few times before I could determine why the\\npsychiatrist had diagnosed him with such a serious disorder. He\\nbegan by telling me that for the last four years he had been depressed\\nand anxious. There was nothing markedly uncommon in that. His\\nsymptoms followed on the heels of a serious fight with his boyfriend\\nand the permanent cessation of their relationship, which had lasted\\nseveral years. Nothing in that was unusual, either. The two had been\\nliving together. Their partnership was important to him, emotionally\\nand practically—and the dissolution of an intimate relationship\\nproduces unhappiness and confusion in most everyone, and can\\ntrigger more severe and lasting anxiety and depression in people who\\nare so predisposed. The duration was out of the ordinary, however.\\nPeople typically pick up the pieces and move on in under a year. That\\n\\n\\x0cis not a hard-and-fast rule, but four years is a long time. That piqued\\nmy curiosity. He also revealed something else very much out of the\\nordinary. He told me that he experienced strange, convulsive bodily\\nmovements—every night—while attempting to sleep. His body would\\ncontort into a fetal position, and his arms would cross over his face.\\nThen he would relax, only to find himself repeating the movements.\\nSo it went, for hours. Apart from being concerning because of its\\nincomprehensibility, it was interfering badly with his sleep. This had\\nbeen going on for about the same amount of time as the anxiety and\\ndepression, and the poor sleep, if not the movements themselves,\\nwas certainly a contributing factor. I asked him what he thought was\\nhappening. He said, with a laugh, “My family thinks I am possessed,\\nand I am not sure they are wrong.”\\n\\nMy client’s familial background was somewhat unusual. His\\nparents, immigrants to Canada from the southern United States,\\nwere uneducated to a marked degree, very superstitious and\\nreligious, and apparently serious in the belief that spirits inhabited\\ntheir son. I asked him, “Did you by chance tell the psychiatrist about\\nbeing possessed?” He said, “Yes.” I thought, “Well, that explains why\\nhe diagnosed you with schizophrenia.” That explanation, in tandem\\nwith the strange physical symptoms, would have been sufficient, in\\nmy experience.* However, after meeting with this man for several\\nsessions, it was clear to me that whatever was plaguing him was not\\nschizophrenia. He was perfectly rational and lucid. But what in the\\nworld could be causing these strange, nightly, seizure-like\\nconvulsions? I had never encountered anything of the sort. My first\\nhypothesis was that he suffered from a very severe form of sleep\\nparalysis. This is a reasonably common condition. It generally occurs\\nwhen people are sleeping on their backs (which he tended to do). A\\nperson with sleep paralysis semi-awakens, but not enough to stop\\ndreaming, nor to escape from the inability to move that characterizes\\nthe rapid-eye-movement (REM) phase of sleeping. When you are\\ndreaming, the same brain areas that govern active movement when\\nyou are awake are often stimulated (you experience this as the sense\\nof moving while in your dream). You do not move around in sync\\nwith that brain activation because your voluntary musculature is\\nswitched off, physiologically, by a specialized neurochemical\\nmechanism that has exactly that function.2 Otherwise you would get\\n\\n\\x0cout of bed and act out your dream and get yourself into trouble very\\nquickly.\\n\\nDuring a sleep paralysis episode, the sufferer wakes up enough to\\n\\nbe semi-aware of the real world, but is still in REM paralysis and\\ndreaming. All sorts of strange experiences can occur in such a state.\\nMany people have, for example, claimed to have been abducted and\\nmedically examined by aliens.3 This otherwise inexplicable nighttime\\nphenomenon (barring the existence of curious and surgically inclined\\nextraterrestrials) has been blamed on this condition of immobility\\nand the often bizarre and frightening fantasies that accompany it.4\\nHe was quite bright, literate, and curious, so I gave him a book called\\nThe Terror That Comes in the Night,5 which illuminates the strange\\nphenomena that can accompany sleep paralysis. The author, David\\nHufford, describes the night terror his title refers to as a variant of\\nthe “Old Hag” experience (a term from folklore). Those who have had\\nsuch an experience (up to 15 percent of the population) describe fear\\nand paralysis, sensations of suffocation, and encounters with malign\\nentities. My client read the book, but told me that he did not believe\\nwhat Hufford described accurately characterized her experience. He\\nfelt the same way about the sleep paralysis hypothesis more\\ngenerally. For one thing, the convulsions occurred before he fell\\nasleep; second, he did not experience the inability to move.\\n\\nI learned much more about him as we continued to get to know\\none another. I learned, for example, that he had studied history as an\\nundergraduate, and had completed his degree. I learned that his\\nparents had been exceptionally strict with him through his childhood\\nand teenage years. They never allowed him to stay overnight at his\\nfriends’ houses, and they monitored his behavior very closely until he\\nescaped to university. He also related a fair bit more about the fight\\nthat occurred immediately before the breakup of his last\\nrelationship. He had returned with his boyfriend to their shared\\napartment after having a few drinks and arguing in public. At home,\\nthe fight escalated to physical conflict. They began pushing each\\nother around, with increasing violence. After one particularly\\naggressive shove, my client fell to the living room floor. While lying\\nthere, he swept his boyfriend’s feet out from underneath him. Then\\nmy client picked himself up off the floor and headed for the door. He\\nreturned several days later when he knew he would not be at home to\\n\\n\\x0cpack up his belongings and move. That was the end of their existence\\nas a couple.\\n\\nBut there was an element of his personality at play in this conflict\\nthat was not obvious. In consequence, he was struck very deeply by\\nhis boyfriend’s assault. He told me while discussing this sequence of\\nevents that he did not believe people were capable of violence. I said,\\n“What do you mean by that? You earned a history degree. You have\\nobviously read about the horrors and atrocities of the human past.\\nYou watch the news . . .” He said that, as a matter of fact, he did not\\nwatch the news. “Fair enough,” I replied, “but what about everything\\nyou learned in university? Did not that teach you that human\\naggression is both real and exceptionally common?” He said, “I read\\nthe books, but I just put everything I had learned into a compartment\\nand did not think any further about it.” I thought that was a striking\\nanswer, particularly in combination with something else he told me.\\n“When I was a child,” he said, “I picked up the idea that people were\\nonly good. My parents taught me that adults were angels.” I asked,\\n“What do you mean by that? That adults never did anything bad or\\nwrong?” He said, “No, you do not understand. My parents taught me\\nand my sister and brother that adults were literally God’s angels, and\\nthat they were only good.” I said, “You believed this?” He said that he\\nhad believed it deeply, partly because he had been so sheltered,\\npartly because his parents had been so insistent, and partly, of\\ncourse, because it was comforting.\\n\\nI suggested that something had to be done about his naivete. It\\nwas not doing him any good. He was far too old and intelligent to\\nmaintain faith in such a childish dream. We discussed this in detail,\\nspeaking about the horrific events of the twentieth century and the\\nmass shootings and other terrors of the more recent past. I asked\\nhim to explain such occurrences, and to pay more attention to any\\nexamples of his own anger and hostility. However, he denied the very\\nexistence of the latter and could not generate any convincing\\nexplanations for the former.\\n\\nSo, I assigned him a book called Ordinary Men.6 That book\\nexcruciatingly details how a group of ordinary policemen from\\nGermany were turned into cold-blooded executioners in Poland\\nduring the Nazi occupation. To call the account chilling is to say\\nalmost nothing. I told him with all due seriousness that he had to\\nread the book as if it really happened, and more, as if he and the\\n\\n\\x0cpeople he knew were capable of the same heinous acts. It was time\\nfor him to grow up. We had established a very solid rapport by this\\ntime, and when I told him that his rose-colored view of the world was\\npresenting him with danger sufficient to destroy his life he took me\\nseriously. The next time I saw him, a week later, he had finished the\\nbook. His face had hardened. He looked older and wiser. I had seen\\nthis happen frequently in my clinical practice when people\\nincorporated the darker parts of themselves, instead of—let us say—\\ncompartmentalizing them. They no longer had the habitual look of\\ndeer caught in the headlights. They looked like people from whom\\ndecisions emanated, rather than people to whom things merely\\nhappened. Then I asked him to read The Rape of Nanking,7 about\\nJapanese atrocities in China in 1937. It is a horrifying book. The\\nwoman who wrote it committed suicide. My client read that, too, and\\nwe talked about it. He emerged sadder, but wiser. His nighttime\\nsymptoms, however, did not abate.\\n\\nNonetheless, his comments about adults-as-angels, claims to have\\n\\ncompartmentalized his knowledge of evil, and the presence of the\\ninexplicable convulsions had started some wheels turning in the far\\nrecesses of my brain. Many years earlier, I had another client (a\\nyoung woman, as is more typically the case) who had hysterical\\nepilepsy—a classic case of Freudian hysteria, where bodily symptoms\\nwere expressing psychological problems. She had been raised in the\\nrural Midwest, in a very repressed, Victorian-like Christian\\nfundamentalist atmosphere. She had one of her “seizures” in my\\noffice—full grand mal. The sight of it left me cold. I watched\\nimpassively as she thrashed and convulsed violently for several\\nminutes, eyes rolled back. I did not worry. I did not feel sorry for her.\\nI did not feel anything. I thought, “Why is this not affecting me? My\\nclient is having, by all evidence, a serious convulsive episode.” I did\\nnot call an ambulance. When she came out of it and sat back down,\\ndazed, I told her that I had responded to her seizure neither\\nphysically nor emotionally as if it were real, despite its otherwise\\nfully credible manifestation. Previously, after pulling similar stunts\\n(consciously? unconsciously? some mixture of the two?), she had\\nbarely skirted consignment to a psychiatric ward. She had also risked\\na diagnosis of psychosis and prescription for the medication\\naccompanying that. We had some very serious talks about what she\\nwas doing. I let her know that I did not buy her epilepsy—that I had\\n\\n\\x0cexperienced it as false, even though it seemed quite real to her. (She\\nhad been tested, by the way, for epilepsy, and the results had come\\nback equivocal.)\\n\\nSo, she was plausibly someone who “somatized,” or physically\\nrepresented their psychological symptoms. Freud noted that such\\nsomatization was often symbolic—that the manner in which the\\nphysical disability or oddity manifested had some meaningful\\nrelationship with the trauma that had precipitated it. Her hysterical\\nepilepsy appeared to originate in her ambivalence and ignorance\\nabout sex, a substantial degree of childish immaturity, and some\\ndangerous game-playing on her part. We made a lot of progress in\\nour discussions. She was far from unintelligent, and the wiser part of\\nher prevailed. Her seizures came to an end, along with the equally\\ndangerous drama. Even better, she avoided the psych ward and\\ncontinued with her university career. In any case, I learned then that\\nFreudian hysterics existed, because I had just worked with one.\\n\\nI began to hypothesize that my current client was suffering, in a\\nsimilar manner, from a somatization disorder. I knew about the fight\\nthat had terminated his last relationship, just before the onset of his\\nsymptoms. Perhaps his strange movements were somehow\\nassociated with that event? I also knew from his own account that he\\ncompartmentalized—that he put things in a corner of his mind where\\nhe would not think about them again. I did not have much\\nexperience with hypnosis but knew both that people capable of\\ncompartmentalization tended to be highly hypnotizable, and that\\nhypnosis had been used with some success (albeit many years ago)\\nwith somatization disorders. Freud used hypnosis to treat his\\nhysterical clients, who were apparently quite numerous during the\\nVictorian period, at least in the upper class, fixated as they were on\\nthe sexual, the theatrical, and the dramatic.8 So, I thought I might try\\nhypnosis to treat my client.\\n\\nNow, I often used guided relaxation techniques on my clients,\\nsitting them comfortably in their armchair in my office, asking them\\nto focus on different parts of their body, from the soles of their feet,\\nstep by step up their legs and torso, with a brief detour down their\\narms, to the top of their head, focusing on their breathing and\\nrelaxing. After seven or eight minutes of the relaxation instructions, I\\nwould count back from ten to one, requesting after each count or two\\nthat they relax more deeply. It was a reasonably good, quick\\n\\n\\x0ctreatment for agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. I decided to start this\\nway, because hypnosis employs essentially the same technique,\\nadding questions about past trauma or other relevant issues once\\nrelaxation had been established. Its effectiveness varies substantially\\nfrom person to person.9 (That is why stage performers who use\\nhypnosis on audience members will bring twenty people to the front\\nof the theater, run through the initial hypnotic suggestions, and then\\nretain only the few who are obviously responsive.) In any case, I told\\nmy client that I thought hypnotizing him and talking about the night\\nhe fought with his boyfriend might be useful. I told him why\\n(suggesting that his nighttime movements might be associated with\\nthat event). Then I told him exactly how we were going to do it, and\\nthat he was free to refuse or agree. I would stop whenever he asked\\nme to, if he asked; and he would remember everything when we were\\nfinished.\\n\\nHe agreed to try, so I began: “Sit comfortably in your chair. Place\\nyour hands on the arms of the chair or in your lap—wherever you are\\nmost comfortable. Close your eyes. Listen carefully to the noises that\\nyou hear in the world around you, and then turn your attention\\ninward to your breathing. Breathe in deeply. . . . Hold it. . . . Breathe\\nout. Move your attention down your body from your breathing to\\nyour thighs, and lower legs, and feet. Let your feet rest heavily on the\\nfloor. Pay attention to your toes, and the soles of your feet, and your\\nankles, and remember to breathe slowly, regularly, and deeply. Let\\nall the tension flow out of your feet. Do not forget to breathe slowly,\\nregularly, and deeply. Pay attention to your calves, and your\\nshins . . .” and so on, up the whole body. Usually.\\n\\nMy client fell spontaneously into a deep hypnotic trance before I\\ngot past his feet. His head lolled heavily. I asked if he could hear me.\\n“Yes,” he said, barely audibly. I had to advance my chair and put my\\near within inches of his mouth to make out what he was saying. I\\nasked him if he knew where he was. “In your office,” he said. That\\nwas good. I said, “We are returning to the time when you had a fight\\nwith your boyfriend, before you moved out. Tell me what happened.”\\nHe said, “We had just returned to our apartment. We had both been\\ndrinking. We were fighting about finances and our future at the bar.\\nWe both got angry. We walked through the doorway of our house—\\nthere.” He half gestured with his arm, although it was still mostly\\nlimp, like the rest of his body. I was watching his eyes dart back and\\n\\n\\x0cforth, like those of someone in REM sleep, under three-quarter-\\nclosed lids. “I was walking backward. We were moving toward the\\nliving room. I pushed him. Then he pushed me back. I pushed him\\nagain. He pushed me backward over our coffee table and onto the\\nfloor. He picked up our floor lamp and held it over his head. I looked\\ndirectly into his eyes. I had never seen an expression so hostile. I\\ncurled into a ball and crossed my hands over my face to protect\\nmyself.” He said all this very slowly, gesturing awkwardly and\\nminimally all the while, pointing as if toward the area in the\\napartment he was imagining. It was uncannily as if he were reliving\\nthe experience in real time. I glanced at the clock. The explanation,\\npreparation, relaxation, and the slow recounting had taken us up to\\nthe one-hour mark—our normal session duration. I said, “I do not\\nwant to push you too far. We are running out of time. When you are\\nready, and comfortable, you might open your eyes and wake up fully.\\nWe could continue next week.” But he did not respond. His head\\ncontinued to loll forward, and his eyes kept moving. I called his\\nname. No change.\\n\\nThis worried me, quite frankly. I had never heard of someone\\nfailing to emerge from a trance when requested. I was not sure what\\nto do. Fortunately, however, he was the last client I was seeing that\\nevening, so I had some time. I thought, “Well, he is in a deep trance\\nand truly immersed in this account. Maybe he needs to tell the whole\\nstory. Let us continue and see what happens. When he is finished\\nwith his account, I will try to bring him around again.” I went out to\\nthe hallway to speak with his waiting aunt, and informed her that we\\nrequired a bit more time. I returned to my office and sat back down,\\nnear him as before. I said, “What happened then?” He replied, “The\\nexpression on his face—I had never seen someone look like that\\nbefore. I was forced to realize then that my boyfriend could want to\\nhurt me; that one person—even if adult—could truly desire to bring\\nharm to another. It was the first time I truly learned that such events\\nwere possible.” He began to weep, but continued his account: “I\\nknocked his feet from under him, got up, and started running. He\\nchased me out of the living room, down the hallway of our house,\\nand through the front door. I could run faster, and got ahead of him.\\nIt was about four in the morning. It was still dark. I was terrified. I\\ngot far enough ahead of him to hide behind some nearby cars. He\\ncould not find me. I watched him looking for a long while. Then he\\n\\n\\x0cgave up and turned around.” He was sobbing openly by this point.\\n“When I was sure he was gone, I went to my mother’s place and\\nstayed there. I could not believe what had happened. He might have\\nkilled me, and he was going to do it on purpose. I couldn’t stand it. I\\npushed it from my mind and tried never to think about it again.”\\n\\nHe fell silent. I called his name. He responded. I asked him, “Do\\n\\nyou know that you are in my office and sitting in the chair you\\nusually occupy?” He nodded. “Are you finished telling me your\\nstory?” He replied in the affirmative. I said, “You did well. It was very\\nbrave of you to go through all that. Are you ready to open your eyes?”\\nHe said that he was. I said, “Take your time. When you are ready,\\ncome back fully awake, slowly. You are going to feel relaxed and well.\\nYou will remember everything you just told me and everything that\\nhappened here.” He nodded. A few moments later he opened his\\neyes. I asked him what had happened—what he remembered. He\\nbriefly recounted the evening’s events, including our initial\\ndiscussion about hypnosis. I then called in his aunt and told her that\\nhe needed to rest at home, with someone in attendance, because the\\nsession had been intense. Adults were not angels, and people could\\nnot only hurt each other—they could desire that hurt with all their\\nheart. But my client did not know what to do with such knowledge,\\nsheltered as he was, deluded as he was by his parents—blind as he\\nallowed himself to remain with his “compartmentalization.” This did\\nnot stop the inarticulate elements of his being from endeavoring to\\ndramatically represent and bring toward consciousness both the fact\\nof intended harm and everything more broadly evil such intent\\nimplied. He found himself compelled to duplicate precisely the\\ndefensive bodily movements he had made to during the fight with his\\nboyfriend.\\n\\nThe next week, my client did not show up for his session. I thought\\n\\n“Oh, God. Maybe I did him some serious damage.” However, he\\narrived on time the next week. He apologized for missing the last\\nsession, but said that he had become extremely upset and was in\\nconsequence too scrambled to attend or even to contact me. I asked\\nwhy. He said, “The day after we last met, I was sitting in a restaurant\\ndowntown, and I saw my old boyfriend!” It was an uncanny\\ncoincidence. “It really rattled me, you know,” he continued, “but\\nnothing came of it, and I calmed down in a day or two. And guess\\nwhat?” “What?” I said. “I only had convulsions one night this week!\\n\\n\\x0cAnd they only lasted a few minutes!” I said, “That is great! That is\\nreally great! What a relief! What do you think changed?” He said,\\n“What really got to me in that fight was not our disagreement about\\nwhat future we wanted. It was not the physical contact—the pushing\\nand shoving. It was the fact that he truly wished me harm. I could see\\nit in his face. His look truly terrified me. I could not handle it. But I\\ncan understand it better now.”\\n\\nI asked him if I could hypnotize him again. “You are obviously\\nbetter,” I said, “but I want to make sure that we got everything.” He\\nagreed, and we began. He fell into a trance just as easily. But this\\ntime, he condensed the story. He got through the whole account in\\nfifteen minutes, as opposed to the ninety required previously. He had\\nextracted what was important: the fact that he was in danger; the fact\\nthat someone wanted to hurt him; the fact that he had defended\\nhimself successfully—the fact that the world was a place inhabited by\\ndemons, so to speak, as well as angels. When I asked him to come\\nout of the trance, in the same way I had before, he opened his eyes\\nalmost immediately, and was calm and fully aware.\\n\\nThe change in his condition was remarkable. The next week, he\\n\\nsaid that his symptoms had disappeared completely. No more\\nconvulsions—and no more belief in the untarnished goodness of\\nmankind. He had grown up and faced the reality of his own\\nexperience, as well as the nature of the world. It was something to\\nsee. Conscious acceptance of the presence of malevolence cured him\\nof years of suffering. He now understood and admitted enough of the\\npotential dangers that surrounded him to make his way in\\nreasonable safety through the world. It was no longer necessary for\\nwhat he had learned but refused to acknowledge to force itself upon\\nhim in its dramatic, embodied manner. He made what he now knew\\npart of his personality—part of the map that would guide him\\nhenceforth in his actions—and freed himself from the ghosts that\\npossessed him.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI had another client, a young man who was terribly bullied in his first\\nyear of vocational college. When he first came to see me, he could\\nbarely talk, and was taking a high dose of antipsychotic medication.\\n\\n\\x0cWhen he sat in the chair in front of the desk in my office, he would\\ntwist his head and shoulders back and forth in a very abnormal and\\nmechanical manner. When I asked him what he was doing, he told\\nme that he was trying to make the shapes go away. Apparently, he\\ncould perceive geometric images of some kind in front of him, and\\nfelt compelled to manipulate them. I never did understand exactly\\nwhat that signified, except that he was in a world of his own.\\n\\nI spent several months working with him, and did it in a more\\n\\nstructured manner than previously—having, in the interim,\\ndeveloped the tools to do so. This client could only communicate a\\nlittle at the beginning of our work together, but that was enough to\\nstart the ball rolling. Some girl at the college had developed a crush\\non him. He informed her that her romantic interest was not\\nreciprocated. She became exceedingly vindictive, and set out to make\\nhis life hell. She spread rumors about his sexual habits. She\\nencouraged some of her male friends to physically threaten him at\\nschool. She had people on hand to humiliate him constantly and\\nunmercifully in transit to and from campus. Noting his distress, his\\nparents alerted the school, but nothing was done to stop the ongoing\\ntorment. Unable or unwilling to tolerate the mounting peer pressure,\\nthe friends he had only recently made began to avoid and then\\nentirely abandoned him. He began to break down, and as his\\nbehavior became stranger, his outcast status was cemented into\\nplace. And he broke.\\n\\nI asked him to let me know exactly what happened—and to reach a\\nlong way back while formulating his answer. I wanted to understand\\nwhat, if anything, made him vulnerable to the situation he found\\nhimself in, and what exactly had happened when he was being\\ntormented by his spurned admirer. And I structured this so that he\\ncould write, as well as talk (more accurately, so that he could talk\\nabout what he was writing). My colleagues and I had developed an\\nonline writing exercise* to provide some helpful structure for those\\ndelving into and making sense of their past. I asked my young client\\nto try it. Because he was too impaired in his motivation and his\\nthoughts to complete the process at home, I had him do his writing\\nin my office. I set him at my computer and asked him to read each\\nquestion in the exercise aloud to me before writing his answer, and\\nthen to read that aloud as well. If I failed to understand something he\\nhad written or felt that more detail was required, I suggested he\\n\\n\\x0cclarify the issues at hand with more writing and read me his\\nrevisions.\\n\\nThe exercise opened by asking him to break his life into key\\nepochs—sections of his autobiographical past that lent themselves\\nnaturally to categorization as a unit or theme. That might be, say, age\\ntwo through kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high\\nschool, college, etc.—although some people are inclined, particularly\\nas they get older, to group their experiences according to the various\\nrelationships of which they were a member. After he subdivided his\\npast in the manner he chose, the exercise then asked him to identify\\nkey experiences during each of those epochs: events that he believed,\\nin retrospect, shaped him as a person, for better or worse. Obviously,\\nevents of the latter type are likely to be marked in memory by\\nnegative emotions such as anxiety, anger, or the desire for revenge—\\nand, perhaps, by a strong tendency to avoid remembering and\\nconsidering altogether.\\n\\nMy client broke his life into the epochs that seemed relevant to\\nhim, and then identified the key events, both positive and negative,\\ncharacterizing each period. Next, he analyzed them causally, coming\\nto understand why some things had gone well, while others had\\ndeteriorated so terribly. He concentrated most intensely on what\\ngave rise to the most disturbing events of the past—assessing\\nparticulars of his own behavior, motivations of other people, and\\ncharacteristics of time and place. He considered what effects those\\nproduced, for better and worse (because we can learn things from\\ndifficult experiences), and thought through what might have\\nhappened or been done differently. The consequence of all this, at\\nleast in principle, was the mining of past experiences for their true\\nperceptual and behavioral significance, and an update of his\\nautobiographical map.\\n\\nAs his account progressed from day care through public schooling\\n\\n—he had divided his life into sections defined by school grade—he\\nbecame increasingly articulate. Recollecting his life was putting him\\nback together. As he wrote, read what he wrote, and answered the\\nquestions I put to him while listening, his account of the past became\\nmore detailed and his understanding of it deeper. We discussed the\\nundesirable things that children do to each other, and that led us to\\nthe topic of malevolence and evil—in the adult world, as well. He was\\nvery naive about this. He expressed the belief that people were\\n\\n\\x0cuniversally good (even though he had experience to the contrary). He\\nhad no theory of motivation for destruction, cruelty, and the desire\\nfor mayhem.\\n\\nWe walked through his life, developing a particularly detailed\\naccount of everything he had suffered at the hands of his tormentor.\\nHe became sophisticated enough to articulate some initial\\nunderstanding of her motivations. She had been spurned and was, in\\nconsequence, hurt, embarrassed, and angry. He had not realized\\neither how much impact his rejection might produce or how much\\nimpact rejection can have on people in general. He did not seem to\\nunderstand, furthermore, that he had the right to defend himself. We\\ntalked about what he could have done differently, or might do\\ndifferently in the future, to protect himself. He realized that he had\\ntaken far too much insult at school without reaching out for help. He\\ncould have let the appropriate administrative staff at the college\\nknow what was going on. He could have confronted his tormentor\\ndirectly, publicly, earlier in the abuse, and demanded that she stop.\\nHe could have let his classmates know that the only reason he was\\nbeing tormented was because he had refused a date, and that she was\\nso fragile and brittle that she could not handle the rejection and was\\ninventing lies for revenge. In the extreme, he could have had her\\ncharged with criminal harassment and defamatory libel. None of\\nthese strategies would have been sure to work, but they would have\\nbeen worth trying, and were certainly justified and necessary under\\nthe circumstances.\\n\\nAs he worked through the memories of his recent month at\\ncollege, his psychotic symptoms receded dramatically. At every\\nsession he attended, he was more clearheaded. He stopped\\nmanifesting his strange behaviors. He enrolled in summer school\\nand finished his remaining coursework. It was a near-miraculous\\nrecovery.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIt is far from uncommon for people to worry, sometimes unbearably,\\nabout what lies ahead of them. That worry is a both a consequence of\\nand an investigation into the multiple pathways extending from now\\ninto the future. Concerns line themselves up, often involuntarily, for\\n\\n\\x0cconsideration: troublesome issues at work, problems with friends\\nand loved ones, practical issues of economic and material survival.\\nEach concern requires multiple decisions: What problems should be\\nsolved? In what order should action proceed? What strategy should\\nbe employed? All of this requires something like choice—free choice,\\nfree will. And the choice to act seems voluntary; it is a simple thing\\n(although very psychologically unsatisfying) to succumb to paralysis\\nof will.\\n\\nTo decide, by contrast, voluntarily and freely, is difficult and\\n\\ndemanding. It feels nothing like the automatic processes of reflexive\\nor habitual pathways moving us thoughtlessly forward. We do not\\nappear to ourselves to be driven by the past, in some fundamentally\\ndeterministic manner, like a mechanical clock in which the spring\\ndrives the gears that turn the hands and tell the time. Instead, when\\nwe decide, we actively confront the future. We seem destined to face\\nsomething akin to unformed potential and to determine what will\\nemerge as the present—and then the past.\\n\\nWe literally make the world what it is, from the many things we\\n\\nperceive it could be. Doing so is perhaps the primary fact of our\\nbeing, and perhaps of Being itself. We face a multitude of prospects—\\nof manifold realities, each almost tangible—and by choosing one\\npathway rather than another, reduce that multitude to the singular\\nactuality of reality. In doing so, we bring the world from becoming\\ninto Being. This is the most profound of mysteries. What is that\\npotential that confronts us? And what constitutes our strange ability\\nto shape that possibility, and to make what is real and concrete from\\nwhat begins, in some sense, as the merely imaginary?\\n\\nThere is something else of perhaps equal import allied with this,\\nimpossible as that might seem, given the very unlikeliness of the role\\nwe appear to play in the shaping of reality. Not only do our choices\\nplay a determining role in transforming the multiplicity of the future\\ninto the actuality of the present, but—more specifically—the ethics of\\nour choices play that role. Actions based upon the desire to take\\nresponsibility; to make things better; to avoid temptation and face\\nwhat we would rather avoid; to act voluntarily, courageously, and\\ntruthfully—these make what comes into Being much better, in all\\nways, for ourselves and for others, than what arises as a consequence\\nof avoidance, resentment, the search for revenge, or the desire for\\nmayhem. This means that if we act ethically, in the deepest and most\\n\\n\\x0cuniversal of senses, then the tangible reality that emerges from the\\npotential we face will be good instead of dreadful—or at least as good\\nas we can make it.\\n\\nEveryone seems to know this. We are universally tormented by\\nour consciences for what we know we should have done yet did not\\ndo. We are tormented equally by what we did but know we should\\nnot have done. Is this not a universal experience? Can anyone escape\\nthe pangs of conscience at four o’clock in the morning after acting\\nimmorally or destructively, or failing to act when action was\\nnecessary? And what is the source for that inescapable conscience? If\\nwe were the source of our own values and masters of our own houses,\\nthen we could act or fail to act as we choose and not suffer the pangs\\nof regret, sorrow, and shame. But I have never met anyone who could\\nmanage that. Even the most psychopathic of people seemed\\nmotivated at least to mask their malfeasance with a layer of lies (with\\nthe depth of that layer precisely proportionate to the severity of the\\nimpropriety in question). Even the most malevolent, it appears, must\\nfind justification for his or her evil.\\n\\nIf we fail to hold ourselves to that standard of responsibility, then\\nother people regard us as lacking in ethics and integrity. And it does\\nnot end there. Just as we hold people (including ourselves)\\naccountable for the wrongs they have done, or the good they have\\nfailed to do, we also believe (or at least act out the proposition) that\\nsomeone who has made a good decision freely, deserves whatever\\nbenefit might come of that decision. It is for that reason that we\\nbelieve each person should justly receive the fruit of their honest and\\nvoluntary labor. There seems something natural and inevitable about\\nsuch judgments; something at work within them that is universal\\nand inescapable, psychologically and socially. What all this means is\\nthat everyone—child, adult, self, others—will rebel against being\\ntreated as a cog in a wheel, incapable of choice and devoid of\\nfreedom, and (similarly) that it is practically impossible to establish a\\npositive relationship with any other (or even our private selves)\\nwithout that attribution of personal agency, free will, and\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x0cThe twin ideas that we all are, as sovereign individuals, first,\\nvoluntarily participating in the act of creation itself and, second,\\ndetermining the quality of that creation with the ethics of our choices\\nfinds reflection in myriad manners within our relationships, private\\nand public. These ideas are also encapsulated and represented in the\\nnarratives, the fundamental narratives, that sit at the base of our\\nculture. These stories—whatever their ultimate metaphysical\\nsignificance—are at least in part a consequence of our watching\\nourselves act across eons of human history, and distilling from that\\nwatching the essential patterns of our actions. We are cartographers,\\nmakers of maps; geographers, concerned with the layout of the land.\\nBut we are also, more precisely and accurately, charters of courses,\\nsailors and explorers. We recall the places we started from, the\\npositions we occupied when our stories began. We remember the\\npitfalls and successes of the past so that we can avoid the former and\\nrepeat the latter. To do so, we need to know where we have been,\\nwhere we currently are, and in what direction we are headed. We\\nreduce that account to its causal structure: we need to know what\\nhappened and why, and we need to know it as simply and practically\\nas possible.\\n\\nIt is for such reasons we are so captivated by people who can tell a\\nstory—who can share their experiences concisely and precisely, and\\nwho get to the point. That point—the moral of the story—is what they\\nlearned about who and where they were or are, and where they are\\ngoing and why. Such information is irresistible to us all. It is how\\n(and why) we derive wisdom from the risks taken by those before us,\\nand who lived to tell the story: “This is what life was like then. This is\\nwhat we wanted, and why. This is what we envisioned, and how we\\nstrategized, planned, and then acted. Sometimes, we succeeded and\\nrealized our aims. But too often (and this is what is crucial to a great\\nstory): here is how what we did not expect occurred, here is how we\\nwere knocked off the path, here are the tragedies we encountered\\nand the mistakes we made—and here is how we put the world back\\ntogether (or failed to do so).” We value such stories particularly if\\nthey have attained the pinnacle of generalizability, representing\\nheroic battles with the unknown, as such, or the dissolution of\\ntyrannical order into revivifying chaos and the (re)establishment of\\nbenevolent society.10 This can be seen everywhere that people tell\\nand listen avidly to stories: and that is literally everywhere.11\\n\\n\\x0cThe most fundamental stories of the West are to be found, for\\nbetter or worse, in the biblical corpus. That collection of ancient and\\neminently influential books opens with God Himself, in His Fatherly\\nguise, portrayed as the ordered entity who confronts chaos and\\ncreates habitable order in consequence:\\n\\nAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness\\nwas upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved\\nupon the face of the waters. (Genesis 1:2)\\n\\nThis formlessness, void, darkness, and water (a confusing\\n\\nconglomeration of attributes) is a consequence of the translation of a\\nbiblical Hebrew phrase, tohu wa-bohu (\\n), made up of two\\nwords, tohuw and bohuw. Tohuw is even more complicated than\\nmere formlessness, etc.; it also means “that which is laid waste,”\\n“vanity” (which might be something likely to be laid to waste,\\npsychologically speaking), and “desert” (which is uninhabitable and\\nvoid).12 It is also associated with another Hebrew word, tehom (\\n), which is the source of the phrase “the deep.” Tehom, in turn,\\nmeans “the abyss,” and is associated with an earlier Sumerian term,\\nTiamat,13 who is the great mother goddess/dragon (and denizen of\\nsalt water) who creates the world with her consort, Apsu, in the\\nMesopotamian creation myth Enuma Elish.\\n\\nAccording to the Genesis account, there exists something—a\\n\\npotential, let us say, associated symbolically with the abyss, with the\\noceanic depths—but also with desert, dragons,\\nmaternality/matriarchy, emptiness, formlessness, and darkness.14\\nThis is all the attempt of poetry and metaphor to give initial, ordered,\\nconceptual form to the formless. The abyss is what terrifies, what is\\nat the end of the earth, what we gaze upon when contemplating our\\nmortality and fragility, and what devours hope. Water is depth and\\nthe source of life itself. The desert is a place of abandonment,\\nisolation, and loneliness, as well as the interregnum between tyranny\\nand the promised land. The dragon is the ancient image of the\\npredator as such—the fire-breathing tree-cat-snake-bird15—eternally\\nlurking in the forest beyond the familiar confines of tribe and village.\\nIt is as well the Leviathan hidden in the salt water, the depths—the\\n\\n\\x0cterrible monster Jehovah refers to overcoming in Job 41:25–34 and\\nin many other places in the Old Testament accounts.16\\n\\nGod has an attribute, or an alternative Person, or a faculty, or a\\ntool that aids Him or that He relies on when confronting possibility\\nand the void. That is the Word, from the Christian perspective—but\\ncertainly the capacity for speech, regardless of religious framework,\\nJewish or Christian. There is a continual insistence in Genesis on the\\nimportance of speech. The act of creation on each day begins with\\nthe phrase “and God said” (with additional emphasis on the act of\\nnaming: “and God called”). The seven days of creation begin:\\n\\nAnd God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\\nAnd God saw the light, that it was good: and God\\n\\ndivided the light from the darkness.\\n\\nAnd God called the light Day, and the darkness he called\\nNight. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\\n(Genesis 1:3–5)\\n\\nAlmost immediately after God first reveals Himself, His creative\\nactions, and the initial creation (thus, almost instantly after we are\\nintroduced to Him), He creates human beings. Three features of that\\ncreation stand forth, in addition to its immediacy: the insistence that\\nmankind is to have dominion* over the rest of creation; the shocking\\nand incomprehensibly modern and egalitarian insistence that God\\ncreated man and woman equally in His own image (stated twice;\\nGenesis 1:27); and the equally unlikely and miraculous insistence\\nthat the creation of humanity was, like the rest of the Creation, good.\\nIf God is, above all, as He is initially described, that implies that the\\nmen and women created in His image share with Him something of\\nimport—or, more to the point, they share an analogous destiny,\\nnecessity, or responsibility.\\n\\nThe Word—the tool God uses to transform the depths of potential\\n—is truthful speech. It appears necessarily allied, however, with the\\ncourage to confront unrealized possibility in all its awful potential, so\\nthat reality itself may be brought forth. Perhaps both this Truth and\\nCourage must finally be subsumed, in turn, under the broader\\nprinciple of Love—love for Being itself, despite its fragility, tyranny,\\nand betrayal; love that has as its aim what is best for the best in\\n\\n\\x0ceverything. It is that combination of Truth, Courage, and Love\\ncomprising the Ideal, whose active incarnation in each individual\\ndoes in fact take the potential of the future and make the best of it.\\nAnd who would deny this? No one teaches a beloved son to cringe in\\nterror and cowardice from what confronts him. No one teaches a\\nbeloved daughter that deceit will set the world right, and that\\nwhatever works expediently is to be practiced, honored, and\\nmimicked. And no one tells anyone he or she cares for that the\\nproper response to Being is hatred and the desire to produce pain,\\nsuffering, mayhem, and catastrophe. Thus, it can be assumed from\\nanalysis of our own behavior that we know the difference between\\nthe pathway of good and the pathway of evil, and that we believe\\nabove all (despite our conscious resistance and prideful argument) in\\nthe existence of both. But there is yet more: the insistence of God on\\nthe goodness of creation reflected the fact that Truth, Courage, and\\nLove were united in His creative action. Thus, there is an ethical\\nclaim deeply embedded in the Genesis account of creation:\\neverything that emerges from the realm of possibility in the act of\\ncreation (arguably, either divine or human) is good insofar as the\\nmotive for its creation is good. I do not believe there is a more daring\\nargument in all of philosophy or in theology than this: To believe\\nthis, to act it out, is the fundamental act of faith.\\n\\nThere is an argument presented much later in the biblical\\n\\nnarrative, in the New Testament. Christ says the following words to\\nHis followers. It is a commentary on the potential for completing\\nyour life, for reclaiming what you have lost—or even discovering\\nwhat you did not know was there:\\n\\nAnd I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek,\\nand ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\\n\\nFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh\\n\\nfindeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\\n\\nIf a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will\\n\\nhe give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish\\ngive him a serpent?\\n\\nOr if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?\\nIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto\\nyour children: how much more shall your heavenly Father\\n\\n\\x0cgive the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? (Luke 11:9–13)\\n\\nThis is not a casual statement. It is not naive. It is not a matter of\\nasking for a present, unearned. God is no granter of casual wishes.*\\nIt is a matter, first, of truly Asking. This means being willing to let go\\nof anything and everything that is not in keeping with the desire.\\nOtherwise there is no Asking. There is only an immature and too-\\noften resentful whim and wish: “Oh, that I could have what I want,\\nwithout doing what is necessary.” That will not suffice. So, to ask,\\nseek, and knock is to do everything required to gather what has been\\nleft unfinished and to complete it, now. And to ask, seek, and knock\\nis, as well, to determine what must be asked for. And that has to be\\nsomething that is worthy of God. Why else would it be granted? How\\nelse could it possibly be granted?\\n\\nImagine for a moment you have been given all you need. There is\\n\\npossibility within you, waiting for the proper demand to release\\nitself. There is all that is outside of you, waiting to inform and teach\\nyou. But all of it is necessary—the good, bad, and unbearable. You\\nknow that when something does not go well, you should analyze the\\nproblem, resolve it, apologize, repent, and transform. An unsolved\\nproblem seldom sits there, in stasis. It grows new heads, like a hydra.\\nOne lie—one act of avoidance—breeds the necessity for more. One\\nact of self-deception generates the requirement to buttress that self-\\ndeceptive belief with new delusions. One devastated relationship,\\nunaddressed, damages your reputation—damages your faith in\\nyourself, equally—and decreases the probability of a new and better\\nrelationship. Thus, your refusal or even inability to come to terms\\nwith the errors of the past expands the source of such error—expands\\nthe unknown that surrounds you, transforms that unknown into\\nsomething increasingly predatory.\\n\\nAnd, while that is happening, you get weaker. You are less than\\nyou could be because you did not change. You did not become who\\nyou could have become as a consequence of that change—and worse:\\nyou have now taught yourself, by your own example, that such\\nturning away is acceptable, and you are therefore more likely to\\ncommit the same error in the future. And what you failed to face is\\nnow larger. This is not the kind of causal process, the kind of positive\\nfeedback loop, that you want to find yourself trapped within. So, you\\n\\n\\x0cmust confess, at least to yourself, and repent, at least within yourself,\\nand you must change, because you were wrong. And you must\\nhumbly ask, and knock, and seek. And that is the great barrier to the\\nenlightenment of which we are all capable in principle. This is not to\\nclaim that the courage necessary to confront the full horrors of life is\\neasy to muster. But the alternative is worse.\\n\\nIt is our destiny to transform chaos into order. If the past has not\\n\\nbeen ordered, the chaos it still constitutes haunts us. There is\\ninformation—vital information—resting in the memories that affect\\nus negatively. It is as if part of the personality is still lying latent, out\\nin the world, making itself manifest only in emotional disruption.\\nWhat is traumatic but remains inexplicable indicates that the map of\\nthe world that guides our navigation is insufficient in some vital\\nmanner. It is necessary to understand the negative well enough so\\nthat it can be circumvented as we move into the future if we do not\\nwish to remain tormented by the past. And it is not the expression of\\nemotion associated with unpleasant events that has curative power.\\nIt is the development of a sophisticated causal theory: Why was I at\\nrisk? What was it about the world that made it dangerous? What was\\nI doing or not doing to contribute to my vulnerability? How can I\\nchange the value hierarchy I inhabit to take the negative into account\\nso that I can see and understand it? How much of my old map do I\\nhave to let crumble and burn—with all the pain dying tissue produces\\n—before I can change enough to take my full range of experience into\\naccount? Do I have the faith to step beyond what should and must\\ndie and let my new and wiser personality emerge? To some great\\ndegree, we are our assumptions. They structure the world for us.\\nWhen basic axioms of faith are challenged (“People are basically\\ngood”), the foundation shakes and the walls crumble. We have every\\nreason to avoid facing the bitter truth. But making what is—and what\\nwas—clear and fully comprehended can only protect us. If you are\\nsuffering from memories that will not stop tormenting you, there is\\npossibility—possibility that could be your very salvation—waiting\\nthere to be discovered.\\n\\nIf old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and\\n\\ncompletely.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\n\\nPLAN AND WORK DILIGENTLY TO MAINTAIN THE\\nROMANCE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI am not a couples’ therapist. But sometimes, when I see a client, it\\nbecomes necessary to include his or her intimate partner in one or\\nmore sessions. I do that only when directly asked. I also make it clear\\nthat the couple should seek out a marital counseling specialist if that\\nis their central goal. However, if one of the primary problems my\\nclient is addressing is dissatisfaction in the marriage, it is often\\ncounterproductive to speak with only one member of the couple.\\nFinally, it is often the case (and no wonder, really) that the partner in\\nquestion does not trust his or her better half’s therapist—me—and a\\nmeeting with all three of us can go a long way toward rectifying that.\\nPrior to meeting with a couple, I will have discussed some basic\\nrules for relationship improvement with my client. Let us say he or\\nshe has decided to make some time for romance: four hours a week\\nor something like that (I am speaking here of adults, with their full\\nshare of responsibilities). Maybe that much can be managed. Maybe\\neven more is possible. But there is not that much time in seven days,\\nand the situation must be set up correctly and carefully. And when all\\nthis is first practiced—all this conscious negotiation and enactment—\\nit is going to be done badly and stupidly, with all the attendant pain,\\nresentment, and vengefulness. And then such negative emotion can\\nbe nursed and the relationship damaged—sometimes permanently.\\nPerhaps my client and his or her partner have become estranged\\n\\nfrom one another over several years when we first start to discuss\\ntheir situation. They are not happy, and they hate me—maybe even\\n\\n\\x0cmore than they hate each other. They sit there, distant, arms crossed\\nand eyes rolling (hopefully not the latter: that is a bad sign1). Neither\\nwill give an inch. I ask them when they last did something romantic\\ntogether; when they last went out together for a date. They laugh\\nruefully, if things have not gone too far, or scoff outright. I suggest,\\nnonetheless, that they try going out with each other; or more, that\\nthey start making dates a regular practice. The former suggestion is\\nbad enough; the second, intolerable. They indicate: “We are not\\ngoing on any damn dates. We dated before we got married, when it\\nwas appropriate. Besides, all we will do is fight.”\\n\\nAnd here is my take on that angry, bitter, and shallow response:\\n\\n“This is the theory you are putting forth: You are never going to\\naccompany each other on another date in your entire married life.\\n(So much for romance and intimacy.) Instead, you are just going to\\ngive that up. Why not, instead, risk the time? Take each other\\nsomewhere nice. Dare to put your arm around your partner, or your\\nhand on a knee (and not your own, either). I know you are angry with\\neach other, and probably for good reason. I have met both of you: I\\nunderstand why you both feel that way :-). But just try it. You do not\\nhave to like it. You do not have to expect to be good at it, or give up\\nyour anger, or have a good time. You just have to tolerate it.”\\n\\nThey both leave incensed at me for suggesting such an irritating\\nidea. But they agree grudgingly, and at their next session inform me:\\n“It happened just as we told you: we had an absolutely wretched\\ntime. We fought before we went out, while we were out, and again,\\nwhen we returned home. We are certainly not going to risk a date\\nagain.” They often evince a certain pride at reaching such a\\nconclusion, as both had generally decided ahead of time that the\\nwhole idea was pointless. So, I ask: “That is the plan, is it? You are\\ngoing to be married for sixty years. You put a small amount of\\nbegrudging effort into having one date. You were already not getting\\nalong, so there was a negligible probability you were going to take\\nany pleasure in it. Besides that, irritated at me as you were for my\\nchildish suggestion, you were both motivated to make it go horribly,\\njust as it did. So, you are done with it. And now you have decided\\nthat this is how you are going to conduct yourselves across the\\ndecades you have promised each other: with spite and bitterness\\ninstead of mutual regard?\\n\\n\\x0c“Let us try thinking about it this way, instead: Neither of you have\\nany skill at dating. One attempt is therefore going to be insufficient.\\nMaybe you need fifteen dates—or forty—because you have lost the\\nknack, need the practice, and must develop the habit and goodwill.\\nPerhaps neither of you are very romantic to begin with; or if you\\nwere once, those days have long gone. This is a skill you must learn,\\nnot an unearned gift from Cupid.”\\n\\nAssume you are married—or the equivalent. Assume, as well, that\\nyou have, or could have, a romantic interlude twice a week. It may be\\nless; it may be more: but we will do the arithmetic for twice weekly.\\nThat is a hundred times a year. Let us imagine that you are going to\\nbe married thirty more years. Thirty times one hundred is three\\nthousand times. Is there not some possibility that you could devote a\\nfraction of all that time to perfecting your technique, seduction,\\ncommunication, and lovemaking? What does it matter, therefore, if\\nyou have fifteen miserable dates before managing one that verges on\\nacceptable? That is fifteen times out of a possible three thousand.\\nThat is half a percent of the romantic time you could possibly spend\\ntogether. Maybe you could dare even more to determine if things\\ncould be set right between you. Why would you possibly assume that\\nsomething as complex as maintaining a marriage could be managed\\nwithout commitment, practice, and effort?\\n\\n“So maybe the first date is wretched and horrible. You never want\\nto repeat it but you do, because you would rather save your marriage\\nthan quit outright. And maybe the next one is five percent better.\\nAnd maybe after some repeated attempts you remember for at least a\\nbrief moment why you once liked the person you married. Perhaps\\nyou manage something a little more exciting than putting your arm\\naround him or her, and perhaps receive a bit of a response from\\nsomeone who actually cares for you somewhere in their now cold and\\nshriveled heart. And if you are in it for the long run, as indicated by\\nthe original marital vows, perhaps you will put in the time to get it\\nright.”\\n\\nAnd maybe the couple has enough sense to do the arithmetic and\\n\\ncontemplate all that wasted time, as well as the bitterness,\\nresentment, and deadness of life without romance, and they agree to\\ngo on another date, or two, or three, or ten—and by the tenth session\\nthey come to see me, smiling, and tell me they had a pretty good\\ntime. And then we have an even more serious discussion about just\\n\\n\\x0cwhat it takes to maintain love and respect, and invoke desire and\\nresponse. How do you find the mystery in the other person over the\\nlong run? Can you muster up the will and the romantic imagination\\nand the playfulness to manage that, each time you are together\\nintimately, for the next three thousand occasions? That is going to\\nrequire some thoughtful effort.\\n\\nFor each person is in truth an unfathomable enigma. With care,\\n\\nyou might keep rediscovering, in the person you have chosen,\\nenough residual mystery to maintain the spirit that first brought you\\ntogether. With care, you can avoid stowing each other away in a\\nconveniently sized box, punishment at hand should either of you\\ndare to emerge, and contempt for the consequent predictability you\\nboth now face lurking not so far beneath the surface. If you are\\nfortunate, you might rekindle that glimpse you had when you first\\nwere attracted to each other, of what your life could be like if you\\nwere better people than you are. That is what happens two people fall\\nunder the spell of love. For a while, both become better than they\\nwere, and see that, but then that magic fades away. Both receive that\\nexperience as a gift. Both have their eyes open and can see what is\\nvisible to no one else. Such love is a glimpse of what could be, if the\\nrelationship remained true. It is delivered as a gift initially, from fate,\\nbut requires tremendous effort to realize and maintain. And once\\nthat is understood, the goal is clear.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe sexual aspect of a relationship can often tell us a great deal about\\nthe whole, but not always. I have known couples who fought like\\nproverbial cats and dogs and who had a wildly successful sex life (at\\nleast in the short term), and other couples who were well suited to\\neach other temperamentally but one or the other could not find the\\nspark. People and their relationships are too complex to reduce to a\\nsingle aspect—but it is still reasonable to note that a good marriage is\\naccompanied by mutual desire, mutually requited. Unfortunately,\\ndesire is not something that can be managed in isolation: “Let us fix\\nour sex life” is a resolution too narrow in ambition to fulfill its aim.\\nThere must be a broader, relationship-wide strategy in place to\\nmaintain romance with your partner across time. Regardless of what\\n\\n\\x0cthat strategy might be, its success is going to depend on your ability\\nto negotiate. To negotiate, you and the person you are negotiating\\nwith must first know what you each need (and want)—and second, be\\nwilling to discuss both forthrightly. There are many serious obstacles\\nboth to knowing what you need and want, and to discussing it. If you\\nallow yourself to know what you want, then you will also know\\nprecisely when you are failing to get it. You will benefit, of course,\\nbecause you will also know when you have succeeded. But you might\\nalso fail, and you could well be frightened enough by the possibility\\nof not getting what you need (and want) that you keep your desires\\nvague and unspecified. And the chance that you will get what you\\nwant if you fail to aim for it is vanishingly small.\\n\\nAim is likely a problem for you. If you have a partner, the problem\\n\\nmay be compounded. The person you have chosen is unlikely to be\\nany smarter about you than you are, except in minor instances (and\\nis in fact likely to be even more in the dark with regard to your\\ninnermost desires). Your failure to specify your desires means your\\nunfortunate lover will have to guess what would please and displease\\nyou, and is likely to be punished in some manner for getting it wrong.\\nFurthermore, given all the things you could want—and do not want—\\nit is virtually certain that your lover will get it wrong. In\\nconsequence, you will be motivated to blame them, at least\\nimplicitly, or nonverbally, or unconsciously, for not caring enough to\\nnotice what you are unwilling even to notice yourself. “If you really\\nloved me,” you will think—or feel, without thinking—“I would not\\nhave to tell you what would make me happy.” This is not a practical\\napproach to a happy marriage.\\n\\nThat is all bad enough, but there is a second and equally severe\\nproblem lurking in the byways. If you have solved the problem of\\nknowing what you want, admitted it to yourself in a verbalizable\\nform, and let someone else know your wishes, you have then granted\\nthem a dangerous source of power. The person whom you have made\\nyour confidant is now in a position to fulfill your desires, but could\\nequally deprive you of what you want, embarrass you for wanting it,\\nor hurt you in some other manner, because you have now made\\nyourself vulnerable. Naive people are possessed of the delusion that\\neveryone is good, and that no one—particularly someone loved—\\nwould be motivated to cause pain and misery, either for revenge, as a\\nconsequence of blindness, or merely for the pleasure of doing so. But\\n\\n\\x0cpeople who have matured enough to transcend their naivete have\\nlearned that they can be hurt and betrayed both by themselves and at\\nthe hands of others. So why increase the odds of being hurt by letting\\nsomeone in? It is to defend against such betrayal that naivete is often\\nreplaced by cynicism, and it must be said in all truth that the latter is\\nan improvement over the former. But such substitution is not the\\nfinal word in wisdom, and thank God for that. Trust in turn trumps\\ncynicism, and true trust is not naivete. Trust between people who are\\nnot naive is a form of courage, because betrayal is always a\\npossibility, and because this is consciously understood. This applies\\nwith particular force within the confines of an intimate relationship.\\nTo trust is to invite the best in your partner to manifest itself, with\\nyourself and your freely given trust as the enticement. This is a risky\\nbusiness, but the alternative is the impossibility of true intimacy, and\\nthe sacrifice of what could have been two minds in dialogue working\\nin tandem to address the difficult problems of life for a single mind\\nstriving in solitude.\\n\\nRomance requires trust—and the deeper the trust, the deeper the\\npossibility for romance. But trust has its requirements, as well, apart\\nfrom the courage required of the individuals wise enough to distrust\\nbut brave enough to risk putting their faith in a partner. The first of\\nthose requirements is truth. You cannot maintain trust in yourself if\\nyou lie. You cannot maintain trust in yourself, likewise, if you act in a\\nmanner that would require a lie if it was discovered. Similarly, you\\ncannot maintain trust in your partner if he or she lies, or betrays you\\nin action or in silence. So, the vow that makes a marriage capable of\\npreserving its romantic component is first and foremost the decision\\nnot to lie to your partner.\\n\\nThere are also immense practical advantages to this, if practiced\\n\\nproperly. There will come a time in your life when you have done\\nsomething you should not have done or failed to do something that\\nyou should have done. You may need advice. You may need support.\\nYou may need exactly what your partner could provide, if only you\\ndared to allow them to help. And at some time they are going to find\\nthemselves in exactly the same position. Life is too difficult to\\nnegotiate alone. If you tell your partner the truth, and you strive to\\nact so that you can tell the truth about how you act, then you have\\nsomeone to rely on when the seas become high and your ship\\n\\n\\x0cthreatens to founder. This can literally be a matter of life or death. In\\na relationship where romance remains intact, truth must be king.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nI have a friend of Scandinavian descent, although he is Canadian. He\\nmarried a Canadian woman, also of Scandinavian descent. They\\ndecided to get married in Sweden, as a tribute to their joint ancestry.\\nThey were both at least nominally Christian, so they were married in\\na ceremony reflecting that. During their exchange of vows, the bride\\nand groom held a lit candle aloft between them. I spent a long time\\nthinking about the significance of that ritual.\\n\\nThere is an ancient conceit in the book of Genesis (2:21–22) that\\nEve was taken out of Adam—created from his rib. Woman from man:\\nthis presents something of a mystery, reversing, as it does, the\\nnormative biological sequence, where males emerge from females at\\nbirth. It also gave rise to a line of mythological speculation,\\nattempting to account for the strangeness of this creative act,\\npredicated on the supposition that Adam, the original man produced\\nby God, was hermaphroditic—half masculine and half feminine—and\\nonly later separated into the two sexes. This implies not only the\\npartition of a divinely produced unity, but the incompleteness of man\\nand woman until each is brought together with the other.2 The fact\\nthat the candle is held jointly indicates the binding of the two\\ncelebrants. The fact that the candle is held aloft, lit, implies that\\nsomething higher—something superordinate—is representing or\\nperforming the union. Light, light in the heavens, light in the\\ndarkness, illumination, enlightenment. Prior to the invention of\\nmodern electric lights, candles were often used for this purpose.\\nEvergreens, the standard choice for Christmas trees, represent life\\nunending, as they do not “die” annually in the same manner as their\\ndeciduous counterparts. Such trees therefore symbolize the Tree of\\nLife, which serves as the very foundation of the cosmos.3 So, we\\nilluminate the Tree of Life, at or near December 21, the darkest time\\nof year, at least in the Northern Hemisphere.4 That is why Christmas\\nis located where it is on the calendar; the reappearance of the light is\\nassociated with the birth of the Universal Savior—signifying the\\neternal reemergence of light in the Stygian blackness.\\n\\n\\x0cChrist has long been regarded as the second (perfected) Adam\\nand, just as there was speculation about the hermaphroditic nature\\nof the first Adam prior to God’s creation of the independent sexes,\\nthere is a line of speculation about Christ’s spiritual perfection being\\na consequence of the ideal balance of masculine and feminine\\nelements.*5 It is very difficult for individuals joining themselves\\ntogether to become desperate enough to cease their hiding and\\navoidance, live in truth, and repair themselves in the light cast by\\ntheir joint existence. It is for this reason that both swear the dread\\nvow of permanence (“What God has joined together, let not man put\\nasunder” [Matthew 19:6]). “I am bound to you,” claims one party to\\nthe agreement. “And I to you,” says the other, and both think, if they\\nhave any sense, that they should each transform themselves and one\\nanother, to forestall any unnecessary suffering. So, what is the\\nsuperordinate principle to which both marital partners must bow? It\\nis not illumination as mere verbal abstraction. It is not that they are\\nonly supposed to think and speak the truth. It is that they are\\nsupposed to act it out. And that is the ancient idea that the Word\\nshould be made flesh.\\n\\nThe individuals who make up a married couple might well engage\\n\\nin a lifelong struggle concerning a single inappropriately\\nconceptualized question: “Who is subordinate to whom in a\\nmarriage?” After all, each might reason, as people commonly do, that\\nsuch an arrangement is a zero-sum game, with one winner and one\\nloser. But a relationship does not have to be and should not be a\\nquestion of one or the other as winner, or even each alternating in\\nthat status, in an approximation of fairness. Instead, the couple can\\ndecide that each and both are subordinate to a principle, a higher-\\norder principle, which constitutes their union in the spirit of\\nillumination and truth. That ghostly figure, the ideal union of what is\\nbest in both personalities, should be constantly regarded as the ruler\\nof the marriage—and, indeed, as something as close to divine as\\nmight be practically approached by fallible individuals. That is what\\nthe ceremony of the candle represents: Neither participant rules the\\nother. Instead, both bow to the principle of illumination. In that\\ncircumstance, it is not that one must abide by what the other wants\\n(or vice versa). Instead, it is that both should be oriented toward the\\nmost positive future possible, and agree that speaking the truth is the\\nbest pathway forward. That orientation and truthfulness will\\n\\n\\x0cengender a transformative dialogue, verbal and nonverbal, if the\\npartners in the arrangement commit to abiding by the consequence\\nof that dialogue. Voluntary subordination to this higher-order\\nprinciple of illumination both unifies and revitalizes.\\n\\nImagine that you have just participated in such a ceremony. What\\ndoes your participation signify? Do you believe in the ideas that you\\nhave just acted out? Do you believe that man and woman were once\\ntogether, as a single being, were then separated, and must be\\nrestored as a unity? You can believe it dramatically, poetically, and\\nmetaphorically instead of merely rationally and mechanically, and\\nthat can lead you to deep truths. Do you want to find your soul mate?\\nIt is a romantic trope, obviously, but there are deep reasons for the\\nexistence of romantic fictions. Maybe you take someone on a date to\\na romantic movie. You both watch the movie hero and heroine find\\ntheir soul mates. If you are fortunate, while you are watching you are\\nthinking, “Well, maybe this person I am sitting with is the one for\\nme, too.” In the best of all situations, that is also what your date is\\nhoping for. Maybe that is too much to hope for in real life. But the\\nromantic part of you is longing for it regardless.\\n\\nThere is an inevitable yearning in our natures for the completion\\n\\nthat someone else might provide. There is a sense that you are\\nmissing something, otherwise, and that only the proper romantic\\nunion will provide it. It is true, too—you are indeed missing\\nsomething. If you were not, sex would never have evolved. The entire\\nbiological course of our destiny, since reproduction progressed past\\nthe mere division of cells, appears driven by the fact that it was better\\nfor two dissimilar creatures to come together to produce a\\ncomparatively novel version of themselves than to merely clone their\\ncurrent embodiment. You have your idiosyncrasies, your blind spots,\\nyour biases. Some of these are implicit. They are often paired\\ninextricably with your unique talents: you seldom gain an advantage\\nwithout a corresponding disadvantage, and you are a particular\\nperson, with particular attributes. If you are on your own, you are\\ninevitably lopsided, one-sided. That is often not for the best.\\n\\nThere is unrealized utility in the marital institution about which\\n\\nwe have become cynical—a consequence of our immaturity and\\nnaivete. A marriage is a vow, and there is a reason for it. You\\nannounce jointly, publicly: “I am not going to leave you, in sickness\\nor health, in poverty or wealth—and you are not going to leave me.”\\n\\n\\x0cIt is actually a threat: “We are not getting rid of each other, no matter\\nwhat.” You are shackled together, like two angry cats at the bottom of\\na barrel with the lid on. In principle, there is no escape. If you have\\nany sense (besides the optimism of new love) you also think, “Oh,\\nGod. That is a horrifying possibility.” The part of you that claims to\\ndesire freedom (but really wants to avoid any permanent and\\ntherefore terrifying responsibility) desires a trapdoor through which\\nescape might be made, if and when it is necessary. That seems\\nconvenient—and it is true that there are unbearable marriages—but\\nit is an option with extreme perils. Do you really want to keep asking\\nyourself for the rest of your life—because you would always have the\\noption to leave—if you made the right choice? In all likelihood, you\\ndid not. There are seven billion people in the world. At least a\\nhundred million (let us say) might have made good partners for you.\\nYou certainly did not have time to try them out, and the probability\\nthat you found the theoretically optimal person approaches zero. But\\nyou do not find so much as make, and if you do not know that you\\nare in real trouble. Furthermore, if you have an escape route, there\\nwill not be enough heat generated in the chamber you find yourself\\njointly trapped in to catalyze the change necessary in both of you—\\nthe maturation, the development of wisdom—because maturation\\nand the development of wisdom require a certain degree of suffering,\\nand suffering is escapable as long as there is an out.\\n\\nYou are not going to get along with your partner—not easily,\\n\\nunless you agree to be tyrannized and silent (and even then you will\\ntake your revenge)—because you are different people. No one just\\nsimply gets along, precisely because of that. And not only are you\\ndifferent from your partner, but you are rife with inadequacies and\\nso is he—or she. And that is not bad enough. There is also the fact\\nthat even people of good will and character locked together in\\nmatrimony will face the mundane, quotidian, dull, tragic, and\\nterrible together, because life can be—and certainly will be at some\\npoint—difficult to the point of impossibility. It is going to be tough.\\nEven if you strive to pull yourselves together, and succeed at that\\nadmirably, there are going to be brutal times, and they are not\\nnecessarily going to be brief. Maybe life will be better if you stay\\ntogether—that is the hope, and the likelihood, as far as I can tell—but\\nthe brutal times will still be there. What is going to make you\\nvoluntarily deal with your differences and establish a genuine\\n\\n\\x0cagreement, a true consensus? You are going to have to negotiate in\\ngood faith, continually, to come to some sort of peaceful and\\nproductive accommodation. And if you do not? You are going to have\\nyour hands around each other’s throats for sixty years.\\n\\nIn clinical practice, I have seen whole families in that situation.\\nImagine five people in a circle. Imagine further that each has their\\nhands around the neck of the person in front of them. All are\\nsqueezing with just enough force to kill in a few decades. This is a\\ndecision, formulated over years of unspoken argument and refusal to\\nnegotiate: “I am going to kill you. It is just going to take me a\\nlifetime.” It is very possible that you have someone you might like to\\nslowly throttle in your family, or who is currently doing it to you.\\nPerhaps not, hopefully not (perhaps you would not admit it even if\\nyou knew it was true)—but it is common enough. If you do not\\nnegotiate peace with your partner, that is the situation you will find\\nyourself in. There are three fundamental states of social being:\\ntyranny (you do what I want), slavery (I do what you want), or\\nnegotiation. Tyranny is obviously not so good for the person\\nenslaved, but it is also not good for the tyrant—because he or she\\nbecomes a tyrant, and there is nothing ennobling about that. There is\\nnothing but cynicism, cruelty, and the hell of unregulated anger and\\nimpulsivity. Slavery is not good either, likewise for the slave and the\\ntyrant. Slaves are miserable, wretched, angry, and resentful. They\\nwill take any and all chances whatsoever available to them to take\\nrevenge on their tyrants, who will in consequence find themselves\\ncursed and damaged by their slaves. It is not easy to get the best out\\nof someone by arbitrarily brandishing a stick at them, particularly\\nwhen they try to do something good (and that diminution of spirit is\\nthe cruelest trick of the tyrant). But you can be certain, you want-to-\\nbe tyrants, that your slaves will take their revenge where they can,\\neven if that means merely being much less than they could be.\\n\\nMy wife told me a terrible story once, about a couple she observed\\nwhile volunteering in a palliative care ward. The husband was dying,\\nand his wife was trimming his nails—a little too close. With each clip,\\nthere was blood, as she trimmed close enough to damage the quick.\\nYou see something like that, and wisdom speaks its terrible truth: “I\\nknow exactly what is going on there.” That is the end stage of an\\nunbelievably deceitful and brutal relationship. It is subtle. It does not\\nannounce itself loudly as murderous. No one knows, except the\\n\\n\\x0ccouple (even though they are perhaps striving with all their might,\\nunder the circumstances, not to know) and the careful observer, who\\nsees a dying man and a wife who has determined, for whatever\\nreasons, to make his death a little worse. That is not a desirable\\noutcome. You do not want to end up in that situation, or anything\\nlike it. You want to negotiate. The question is, “What is going to\\nmake you desperate enough to negotiate?” And that is one of the\\nmysteries that must be addressed if you wish to keep the romance\\nalive in your relationship.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nNegotiation is exceptionally difficult. We already discussed the\\nproblems associated with determining what you want and then\\nmustering up the courage to tell someone exactly that. And there are\\nthe tricks that people use, too, to avoid negotiation. Perhaps you ask\\nyour partner what he or she wants—perhaps during a difficult\\nsituation. “I don’t know” is a common answer (you get that from\\nchildren, too, and even more often from adolescents). It is not\\nacceptable, however, in a discussion that cannot in good faith be\\navoided. Sometimes “I don’t know” truly means what it is supposed\\nto mean—the person who utters the phrase is at a genuine loss—but\\noften it means, instead: “I don’t want to talk about it, so go away and\\nleave me alone.” Irritation or outright anger, sufficient to deter the\\nquestioner, often accompanies this response. That brings the\\ndiscussion to a halt, and it can stay halted forever. Maybe that has\\nhappened once or twice or a dozen times too often, so you—the\\nquestioner, in this instance—have had enough of your partner’s\\nrefusal, or you have decided that you are done being cowardly or a\\nvictim of your own misplaced compassion and you are not about to\\ntake “I don’t know” for an answer. In consequence, you persist in\\npursuing your target. “Well, guess,” you might say. “Throw\\nsomething on the table, for God’s sake. I do not care what it is. Even\\nif it is wrong, it is at least a start.” “I don’t know” means not only “Go\\naway and leave me alone.” It also frequently means “Why don’t you\\ngo away, do all the work necessary to figure out what is wrong, and\\ncome back and tell me—if you’re so smart,” or “It is intolerably rude\\nof you to refuse to allow me to remain in my willful or dangerous\\n\\n\\x0cignorance, given that it obviously bothers me so much to think about\\nmy problems.” It is not rude, though—or even if it is, you still need to\\nknow what your partner wants, and so does he or she, and how in the\\nworld are either or both of you going to figure it out if you cannot\\neven get the conversation off the ground? It is not rude. It is a cruel\\nact of love.\\n\\nPersistence under such conditions is a necessity, a terrible\\n\\nnecessity, akin to surgery. It is difficult and painful because it takes\\ncourage and even some foolhardiness to continue a discussion when\\nyou have been told in no uncertain terms by your partner to go the\\nhell away (or worse). It is a good thing, however—an admirable act—\\nbecause a person bothered by something they do not wish to talk\\nabout is very likely to be split internally over the issue at hand. The\\npart that wants to avoid is the part that gets angry. There is a part\\nthat wants to talk, too, and to settle the issue. But doing so is going to\\nbe cognitively demanding, ethically challenging, and emotionally\\nstressful. In addition, it is going to require trust, and people test\\ntrust, not least by manifesting anger when approached about\\nsomething touchy just to determine if the person daring the\\napproach cares sufficiently to overcome a serious barrier or two or\\nthree or ten to get to the horrible bottom of things. And avoidance\\nfollowed by anger is not the only trick in the book.\\n\\nThe next serious hurdle is tears. Tears are easily mistaken for the\\n\\ndistress due to sadness, and they are very effective at bringing\\ntenderhearted people to a dead halt as a consequence of their\\nmisplaced compassion. (Why misplaced? Because if you leave the\\nperson alone because of their tears, they quit suffering right then, but\\ncontinue with their unresolved problem until they solve it, which\\nmight be never.) Tears, however, are just as often anger (perhaps\\nmore often) as they are sadness or distress. If the person you are\\nchasing down and cornering is red-faced, for example, in addition to\\ntheir tears, then he or she is probably angry, not hurt (that is not\\ninevitably the case, but it is a reasonably common sign). Tears are an\\neffective defense mechanism, as it takes a heart of stone to withstand\\nthem, but they tend to be the last-ditch attempt at avoidance. If you\\ncan get past tears, you can have a real conversation, but it takes a\\nvery determined interlocutor to avoid the insult and hurt generated\\nby anger (defense one) and the pity and compassion evoked by tears\\n(defense two). It requires someone who has integrated their shadow\\n\\n\\x0c(their stubbornness, harshness, and capacity for necessary\\nemotionless implacability) and can use it for long-term benefit. Do\\nnot foolishly confuse “nice” with “good.”\\n\\nRemember the options previously discussed: negotiation, tyranny,\\n\\nor slavery. Of those, negotiation is the least awful, even though it is\\nno joke to negotiate, and it is perhaps the most difficult of the three,\\nin the short term, because you have to fight it out, now, and God only\\nknows how deep you are going to have to go, how much diseased\\ntissue you will have to remove. For all you know, you are fighting\\nwith the spirit of your wife’s grandmother, who was treated terribly\\nby her alcoholic husband, and the consequences of that unresolved\\nabuse and distrust between the sexes are echoing down the\\ngenerations. Children are amazing mimics. They learn much of what\\nthey know implicitly long before they can use language, and they\\nimitate the bad along with the good. It is for this reason that it has\\nbeen said that the sins of the fathers will be visited on the children to\\nthe third and fourth generation (Numbers 14:18).\\n\\nHope, of course, can drive us through the pain of negotiation, but\\nhope is not enough. You need desperation, as well, and that is part of\\nthe utility of “till death do us part.” You are stuck with each other, if\\nyou are serious—and if you are not serious, you are still a child. That\\nis the point of the vow: the possibility of mutual salvation, or the\\nclosest you can manage here on Earth. In a truly mature marriage, if\\nyour health holds out, you are there for the aforementioned sixty\\nyears, like Moses in the desert searching for the Promised Land, and\\nthere is plenty of trouble that must be worked through—all of it—\\nbefore peace might be established. So, you grow up when you marry,\\nand you aim for peace as if your soul depends upon it (and perhaps\\nthat is more serious than your life depending on it), and you make it\\nwork or you suffer miserably. You will be tempted by avoidance,\\nanger, and tears, or enticed to employ the trapdoor of divorce so that\\nyou will not have to face what must be faced. But your failure will\\nhaunt you while you are enraged, weeping, or in the process of\\nseparating, as it will in the next relationship you stumble into, with\\nall your unsolved problems intact and your negotiating skills not\\nimproved a whit.\\n\\nYou can keep the possibility of escape in the back of your mind.\\nYou can avoid the commitment of permanence. But then you cannot\\nachieve the transformation, which might well demand everything\\n\\n\\x0cyou can possibly muster. The difficulty, however, that is implicit in\\nthe negotiation carries with it a tremendous promise, which is part of\\na radically successful life: You could have a marriage that works.\\nYou could make it work. That is an achievement—a tangible,\\nchallenging, exceptional, and unlikely achievement. There are not\\nmany genuine achievements of that magnitude in life; a number as\\nsmall as four is a reasonable estimate. Maybe, if you strive for it, you\\nhave established a solid marriage. That is achievement one. Because\\nof that, you have founded a solid and reliable, honest and playful\\nhome into which you could dare bring children. Then you can have\\nkids, and with a solid marriage that can work out for you. That is\\nachievement two. Then you have brought upon yourself more of the\\nresponsibility that will demand the best from you. Then you will have\\nnew relationships of the highest quality, if you are fortunate and\\ncareful. Then you will have grandchildren so that you are surrounded\\nby new life when yours begins to slip away. In our culture, we live as\\nif we are going to die at thirty. But we do not. We live a very long\\ntime, but it is also all over in a flash, and it should be that you have\\naccomplished what human beings accomplish when they live a full\\nlife, and marriage and children and grandchildren and all the trouble\\nand heartbreak that accompanies all of that is far more than half of\\nlife. Miss it at your great peril.\\n\\nYou meet people, usually young, unwise but laden with the\\nunearned cynicism that substitutes for wisdom in youth, and they\\nsay, categorically—even pridefully—“I do not want children.” Plenty\\nof nineteen-year-olds say that, and that is acceptable, in some sense,\\nbecause they are nineteen, and they have time, and what do they\\nknow at nineteen, anyway? And some twenty-seven-year-olds say\\nthat, but not so many, particularly if they are female and the least bit\\nhonest with themselves. And some forty-five-year-olds say the same\\nthing, in the past tense, and some of them, perhaps, are telling the\\ntruth; but most are celebrating closing the barn door after the cattle\\nhave bolted. No one will speak the truth about this. To note outright\\nthat we lie to young women, in particular, about what they are most\\nlikely to want in life is taboo in our culture, with its\\nincomprehensibly strange insistence that the primary satisfaction in\\nthe typical person’s life is to be found in career (a rarity in itself, as\\nmost people have jobs, not careers). But it is an uncommon woman,\\nin my clinical and general professional experience, regardless of\\n\\n\\x0cbrilliance or talent, training, discipline, parental desire, youthful\\ndelusion, or cultural brainwashing who would not perform whatever\\nsacrifice necessary to bring a child into the world by the time she is\\ntwenty-nine, or thirty-five, or worse, forty.\\n\\nHere is a pathway to misery I would strongly recommend\\navoiding, aimed primarily at the women who read this book\\n(although wise boyfriends and husbands should take equal note).\\nDecide that you want children when you are twenty-nine or thirty,\\nand then be unable to have them: I would not recommend that. You\\nwill not recover. We are too fragile to play around with what life\\nmight offer us. Everyone thinks, when they are young and do not\\nknow any better, “Well, pregnancy can be taken for granted.” That is\\nonly true if you absolutely do not want and should not have a child,\\nand you have sex in the backseat of a car when you are fifteen. Then,\\nfor sure, you will find yourself in trouble. But a successful pregnancy\\nis not a foregone conclusion, not by any stretch of the imagination.\\nYou can push trying for children to the older end of that spectrum—\\nand many people are encouraged or encourage themselves to do\\nexactly that—but up to 30 percent of couples experience trouble\\nbecoming pregnant.6\\n\\nYou encounter something similar—that is, the incaution about\\nwhat life will and will not offer—when people whose marriages have\\nstagnated begin to develop the delusion that a romantic affair will\\naddress their unmet needs. When I had clients considering such a\\nmove—or perhaps involved in an affair, currently—I tried to bring\\nthem back down to earth. “Let us think it through, all the way. Not\\njust for this week, or this month. You are fifty. You have this twenty-\\nfour-year-old, and she is willing to break up your marriage. What is\\nshe thinking? Who must she be? What does she know?” “Well, I am\\nreally attracted to her.” “Yes, but she has a personality disorder.\\nSeriously, because what the hell is she doing with you, and why is she\\nwilling to break up this marriage?” “Well, she does not care if I stay\\nmarried.” “Oh, I see. So, she does not want to have an actual\\nrelationship with someone, with any degree of long-term\\npermanency. Somehow that is going to work out well for you, is it?\\nJust think about that. It is going to be a little rough on your wife. A\\nlot of lies are going to go along with that. You have children—how are\\nthey going to respond when all this comes out, as it most certainly\\nwill? And what do you think about the ten years in court that are now\\n\\n\\x0cbeckoning, that are going to cost you a third of a million dollars and\\nput you in a custody battle that will occupy all your time and\\nattention?”\\n\\nI have seen people who were in custody battles who would\\n\\nseriously have preferred cancer. It is no joke to have your arm caught\\nin the dangerous machinery of the courts. You spend much of the\\ntime truly wishing you were dead. So that is your “affair,” for God’s\\nsake. It is even more delusional than that, because, of course, if you\\nare married to someone, you often see them at their worst, because\\nyou have to share the genuine difficulties of life with them. You save\\nthe easy parts for your adulterous partner: no responsibility, just\\nexpensive restaurants, exciting nights of rule breaking, careful\\npreparation for romance, and the general absence of reality that\\naccompanies the privilege of making one person pay for the real\\ntroubles of existence while the other benefits unrealistically from\\ntheir absence. You do not have a life with someone when you have an\\naffair with them. You have an endless array of desserts (at least in the\\nbeginning), and all you have to do is scoop the whipped cream off the\\ntop of each of them and devour it. That is it. You see each other\\nunder the best possible conditions, with nothing but sex in your\\nminds and nothing else interfering with your lives. As soon as it\\ntransforms from that into a relationship that has any permanency, a\\nhuge part of the affair immediately turns right back into whatever it\\nwas that was bothering you about your marriage. An affair is not\\nhelpful, and people end up horribly hurt. Particularly children—and\\nit is to them you owe primary allegiance.\\n\\nI am not trying to be unreasonably categorical about marriage and\\n\\nfamily. You cannot expect every social institution to work out for\\neveryone. Sometimes, you have married someone who is a\\npsychopathic brute, a congenital and incorrigible liar, a criminal, an\\nalcoholic, a sadist (and maybe all five at once). Then you must\\nescape. But that is not a trapdoor. That is a catastrophe, like a\\nhurricane, and you should move out of its path. You might be\\ntempted to conclude: “Well, how about we live together, instead of\\ngetting married? We will try each other out. It is the sensible thing to\\ndo.” But what exactly does it mean, when you invite someone to live\\nwith you, instead of committing yourself to each other? And let us be\\nappropriately harsh and realistic about our appraisal, instead of\\npretending we are taking a used car for a test jaunt. Here is what it\\n\\n\\x0cmeans: “You will do, for now, and I presume you feel the same way\\nabout me. Otherwise we would just get married. But in the name of a\\ncommon sense that neither of us possesses we are going to reserve\\nthe right to swap each other out for a better option at any point.” And\\nif you do not think that is what living together means—as a fully\\narticulated ethical statement—see if you can formulate something\\nmore plausible.\\n\\nYou might think, “Look, Doc, that is pretty cynical.” So why not we\\n\\nconsider the stats, instead of the opinion of arguably but not truly\\nold-fashioned me? The breakup rate among people who are not\\nmarried but are living together—so, married in everything but the\\nformal sense—is substantially higher than the divorce rate among\\nmarried couples.7 And even if you do get married and make an\\nhonest person, so to speak, of the individual with whom you\\ncohabited, you are still much more rather than less likely to get\\ndivorced than you would be had you never lived together initially.8 So\\nthe idea of trying each other out? Sounds enticing, but does not\\nwork.\\n\\nIt is of course possible that people who are more likely to get\\ndivorced, for reasons of temperament, are also more likely to live\\ntogether, before or without marriage, rather or in addition to the\\npossibility that living together just does not work. It is no simple\\nmatter to disentangle the two causal factors. But it does not matter,\\npractically. Cohabitation without the promise of permanent\\ncommitment, socially announced, ceremonially established, seriously\\nconsidered, does not produce more robust marriages. And there is\\nnothing good about that—particularly for children, who do much\\nworse in single parent (generally male-absent) families.9 Period. So, I\\njust do not see it as a justifiable social alternative. And I say that as\\nsomeone who lived with my wife before I married her. I am not\\ninnocent in this regard. But that does not mean I was right. And\\nthere is something else, and it is far from trivial. You just do not have\\nthat many chances in life to have an intimate relationship work out\\nproperly. Maybe it takes you two or three years to meet the potential\\nMr. or Ms. Right, and another two or three to determine if they are in\\nfact who you think they are. That is five years. You get old a lot faster\\nthan you think you will, no matter how old you are now, and most of\\nwhat you could do with your family—with marriage, children, and so\\nforth—is from twentysomething to about thirty-five. How many good\\n\\n\\x0cfive-year chances do you therefore have? Three? Four, if you are\\nfortunate?\\n\\nThis means that your options decrease as you wait, rather than\\n\\nincrease. If you are a widower, or a widow, and you must hit the\\ndating scene when you are forty or fifty, so be it. You have been\\nstruck by tragedy, and that is life. But I have watched friends do it,\\nand it is not a fate I would casually wish on anyone I loved. Let us\\ncontinue to be reasonable about this: All sixteen- to eighteen-year-\\nolds have much in common. They are unformed. They are malleable.\\nThat is not an insult. It is just a fact. It is also why they can go off to\\ncollege and make a lifelong friend (no cynicism whatsoever intended)\\nfrom a roommate within a single semester. By the time you are in\\nyour midforties, however—if you have lived at all—you have become\\nsomewhat of a singular and unique person. I have known people I\\nmet at that time of my life for a decade or more whom I still seem to\\nconsider new acquaintances. That is a pure function of the\\ncomplexity of increasing age. And that is mere friendship, not love—\\nnot a joint life and perhaps even the bringing together of two\\ndisparate families.\\n\\nAnd so you have your marriage and your children, and that is\\nworking out well because you are stubborn and sufficiently terrified\\nof the hell that awaits anyone who fails to negotiate for peace and\\nmake the sacrifices necessary to establish it. You are undoubtedly\\nmore prepared now for your career—or more likely, your job. That is\\nthe third of the four achievements you might manage, with good\\nfortune and an undaunted spirit, in the brief flash of your existence.\\nYou have learned how to establish productive harmony in the close\\nconfines of your most intimate and private relationships, and some\\nof that wisdom spills over into your workplace. You are a mentor for\\nyounger people, a helpful peer and reliable subordinate, and instead\\nof the hash you could so easily make of the place you inhabit, you\\nimprove it. And if everyone did that the world would be a much less\\ntragic and unhappy place. Maybe it would even be a self-evidently\\ngood place. And perhaps you learn how to make good use of your\\ntime away from family and work—your leisure—and you make that\\nmeaningful and productive. And that is the fourth of the four\\nachievements—and one, like the others, that can grow. Perhaps you\\nget better and better at such things so that you can work on solving\\n\\n\\x0cmore and more difficult problems, and become a credit, in your own\\nway, to the spirit of humanity itself. And that is life.\\n\\nBack to marriage. How do you plan and diligently maintain the\\n\\nromance in your relationship? Well, you have to decide: “Do you\\nwant some romance in your life or not?” If you really think about it,\\nwithout resentment—without the joy of depriving your partner, now\\nalienated, of the pleasure that might come with such an attempt—the\\nanswer is generally yes. Sexual romance: the adventure, pleasure,\\nintimacy, and excitement people fantasize about experiencing, when\\nthey are feeling in need of a touch of the divine. You want that. The\\njoys of life are rare and precious, and you do not want to forsake\\nthem without due cause. How are you going to accomplish that?\\nWith luck, it will happen between you and someone you like; with\\nbetter luck, and sufficient commitment, it will happen between you\\nand someone you love. Little about this is easy. If you set up a\\nhousehold with someone, you are going to have to do an awful lot of\\nnegotiation to keep both “like” and “love” alive.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nHere are some practical considerations. They may seem far from the\\ntopic of romance. The discussion is necessary, however, because we\\ntranscended—or lost—our traditional roles, and have not formulated\\nreplacements for them. Before that—perhaps before the invention of\\nthe birth control pill, which was a biological revolution—men did\\nmale things, whatever they were, and women did female things,\\nwhatever they were. Traditional roles are far more helpful than\\nmodern people, who vastly overestimate their tolerance for freedom\\nand choice, tend to realize. In a less rapidly mutable society,\\neveryone has some sense of their respective duties. That does not\\neliminate the tension (nothing eliminates the tension), but at least\\nthere is a template. If there is no template for what either of you\\nshould be doing when you live together with someone, then you are\\nrequired to argue about it—or negotiate about it, if you are good at\\nthat, which you are probably not. Few people are.\\n\\nIf you are going to set up a household in peace with someone you\\nlove and hopefully like, and wish to continue loving and liking, you\\nare going to have to determine in some manner who is going to do\\n\\n\\x0cwhat. That is the replacement for roles. Who makes the bed? When\\nshould it be made? At what level of perfection does the bed have to\\nbe made to be mutually acceptable? And if this is not handled well,\\nthe conversation becomes counterproductive rapidly: “I made the\\nbed.” “Well, you did not do a very good job.” “Nothing’s ever good\\nenough for you. If you do not think I did a good enough job making\\nthe bed, maybe I will just stop, and you can make it yourself!” “Well,\\nmaybe you should raise your standards a bit, and maybe not just\\nabout the bed!” It is going to take days to sort that out—if it ever does\\nget sorted out—and that is just the bed. That is just the first ten\\nminutes of the morning. So maybe it remains unmade or made badly\\nand bitterly for the next sixty years (there is that time span again),\\nand there are many more domestic issues to address than just the\\nbed. But if that is not sorted out, then it is a problem every morning\\nof every day and every day of every week and month and year and\\neveryone is angry at least under the surface as soon as they awaken\\nor every time they enter the bedroom and other things begin to fall\\nout of order. There is nothing good about that.\\n\\nWhose career is going to take priority? When and why? How will\\nthe children be educated and disciplined, and by whom? Who does\\nthe cleaning? Who sets the table? Takes out the garbage? Cleans up\\nthe bathroom? How are the bank accounts set up and managed?\\nWho shops for groceries? Clothes? Furniture? Who pays for what?\\nWho adopts responsibility for the taxes? Et cetera, et cetera, et\\ncetera. Two hundred things, perhaps, to run a household properly—\\nas complex a problem as running a business, with the additional\\ndifficulty of trying to manage it with a family member, much of it\\nrepeated daily. Your life is, after all, mostly composed of what is\\nrepeated routinely. You either negotiate responsibility for every\\nsingle one of these duties or you play push and pull forever, while\\nyou battle it out nonverbally, with stubbornness, silence, and half-\\nhearted attempts at “cooperation.” That is not going to do your\\nromantic situation any good. It is of vital necessity, in consequence,\\nto place the domestic part of the household economy on firm ground.\\n\\nIt is an incredibly difficult set of problems to solve, because it\\nmeans you must consciously sort the hierarchy of responsibilities\\nbetween the partners in the household. You are required to negotiate\\nevery damned and apparently trivial detail (but the apparent\\ntriviality is a delusion): Who prepares the meals? When do they\\n\\n\\x0cprepare the meals? What is that worth in terms of trade-off for other\\ntasks? How do you thank someone for conducting themselves\\nproperly in the kitchen? Who loads the dishwasher? Who does the\\ndishes? How fast do the dishes have to be cleared off the table after\\nyou eat? Which dishes are going to be used? What are we going to\\neat? What role are the kids going to play? Do we sit down together?\\nDo we have regular mealtimes? Each of these questions can become\\na bloody war. One person thinks one thing, and the other person\\nthinks another thing, and who knows who’s right? So, you have to\\nhave a struggle with it, and you have to come to a consensus. Doing\\nso is difficult. Maybe it means hundreds of fights. It certainly means\\ndozens. But they are fights with a purpose, and that purpose is to\\nfight it out until a solution arises, so that fights about that issue are\\nno longer necessary. That makes peace the goal, and it cannot be\\nestablished except through negotiation, and that requires a\\ncommitment strong enough to withstand serious and deep conflict.\\nThe next thing you have to do—I know this from both my clinical\\nand marital experience (thirty years of each)—is actually talk to your\\npartner for about ninety minutes a week, purely about practical and\\npersonal matters. “What is happening to you at work?” “What is\\ngoing on, as far as you are concerned, with the kids?” “What needs to\\nbe done around the house?” “Is there anything bothering you that we\\ncan address?” “What do we have to do that is necessary to keep the\\nwolf from the door next week?” Just pure, practical communication:\\npartly because you have a story, your partner has a story, and you\\nhave a joint story. To know your story, you must tell it, and, for your\\npartner to know it, he or she must hear it. It is necessary for that\\ncommunication to happen on an ongoing basis. It does not have to\\nbe ninety minutes all at once. Maybe it can be fifteen minutes a day.\\nBut you keep those lines of pragmatic communication open, so you\\nknow where the other person is, and vice versa. If you dip below\\nninety minutes a week, you generate a backlog, and your mutual\\nstory begins to unwind. At some point, that backlog is so large that\\nyou do not know who you are yourself, and you certainly do not know\\nwho your partner is, and you become mutually alienated. Your\\nrelationship loses its coherence. That is a bad situation.\\n\\nWhen I am helping someone straighten out their marriage, let us\\n\\nsay, we do very mundane things. I am not interested in vacations,\\nspecial occasions, or anything that happens that is out of the\\n\\n\\x0cordinary. It is not that those things are unimportant, but they are not\\nvital in the same sense that daily routines are vital. It is the latter that\\nmust be set right. I want to know what interrelationships constitute\\nthe bulk of your typical day. You wake up together, perhaps; you eat\\ntogether. You do such things every day. Maybe waking up, preparing\\nfor the day, and eating make up five hours a day. That is a third of\\nyour waking time and, therefore, a third of your life. It is thirty-five\\nhours every seven days—a whole workweek; an entire career. Get it\\nright. Ask yourself and each other: How do we want these times to be\\nstructured? How can we make the morning awakening pleasant? Can\\nwe attend to each other politely and with interest and perhaps\\nwithout electronic distractions while we eat? Could we make our\\nmeals delicious and the atmosphere welcoming? Consider coming\\nhome in the evening. Let us say that routine takes ten minutes. So\\nthat is another hour plus per week; fifty hours a year—one and a half\\nworkweeks. You spend one and a half workweeks a year being\\ngreeted as you come in the door. It is a sizable fraction of your\\nexistence. Does somebody meet you at the door and indicate a\\ncertain degree of happiness to see you, or are you ignored because\\neveryone is using their smartphones, or met with a litany of\\ncomplaints? How would you like to organize that, so you do not\\ndread the moment you arrive at home? There are things you do\\ntogether that are mundane things; those things you do every day. But\\nthey are your whole life. You get those things right and you have\\nestablished yourself much more effectively than you might realize. If\\nyou can successfully fight the war that establishes harmony in the\\ndomestic economy, you have both won a major victory. And then you\\ncan concentrate on what might happen during a romantic vacation to\\na boutique hotel, or your parents’ cottage, or an all-inclusive resort,\\nor an adventure holiday—or just during that twice-weekly date we\\ndiscussed earlier that you are both so reluctant to attempt.\\n\\nStart by getting these things straight, and see what happens. Then\\n\\nyou will have peaceful mealtimes, for example, and you will not die\\nof frustration or high blood pressure. You will have to fight for such\\nan accomplishment. What matters, however, is not whether you fight\\n(because you have to fight), but whether you make peace as a\\nconsequence. To make peace is to manage a negotiated solution. And\\nyou want and need to come to a negotiated solution about every\\nresponsibility and opportunity you share as a couple—and about\\n\\n\\x0cevery obstacle you encounter. At least then you will have someone to\\ntalk things through with when your life gets complex, as it inevitably\\nwill. And you have the advantage of two heads, even though they will\\nnot see eye to eye. What all this means is that the problems of\\nknowing what you want and discussing it with your partner must be\\nsolved before the romance in your relationship can be maintained.\\n\\nOther people keep you sane. That is partly why it is a good idea to\\n\\nget married. Why? Well, you are half insane, and so is your spouse\\n(well, maybe not half—but plenty). Hopefully, however, it is not\\ngenerally the same half. Now and then you meet couples who have\\nthe same weakness, and they compound that failing in each other.\\nMaybe they are both too fond of wine, for example, and they drift\\ntogether toward alcoholism. What you might want, to avoid such a\\nfate, is that one person in the couple is fond of alcohol, but not both.\\nThis will cause a certain amount of short-term conflict, in situations\\nwhere drinking is occurring or likely to occur, but the long-term\\nconsequences (avoiding either of you becoming an alcoholic) are\\nlikely to be beneficial. The one who does not drink will have a drink\\nor two on a social occasion, just to avoid being too rigid and horrible,\\nand the one who likes to drink will get what is hopefully a salutary\\nreprimand if he or she does not exercise proper control.\\n\\nIt is a fortunate happenstance, generally speaking, that your\\nidiosyncrasies are likely to be somewhat randomly distributed, and\\nthat if you unite with someone else you are likely to find some\\nstrength where you are weak and vice versa. When you unite the two\\nof you to recreate that original being—that is the symbolic idea—then\\nyou have a chance of producing one reasonable, sane being. That is\\ngood for you both, even better for your children (who now have a\\nfighting chance of adapting to what constitutes generally sane\\nbehavior), and it is good for friendship and the broader world, too.\\nA lot of that movement toward functional unity is a consequence\\n\\nof dialogue and communication. If you are old enough, you know\\nthat people are badly broken. When you are young and not very\\nexperienced, you are likely to make two assumptions, in a rather\\nunquestioning and implicit manner, that are simply not true. The\\nfirst is that there is someone out there who is perfect. You are likely\\neven to encounter this hypothetically perfect person, whom you view\\nthrough your delusion, and to fall desperately and foolishly in love\\nwith them (foolishly because you are in love with your projection of\\n\\n\\x0cperfection, rather than the person—which is very confusing to the\\ntarget of your affection). The second assumption is that there is\\nsomeone out there who is perfect for you. From these assumptions,\\nyou are making at least three errors, which is quite an\\naccomplishment, given you have made only two assumptions.\\n\\nTo begin with, there is not anyone out there who is perfect. There\\nare just people out there who are damaged—quite severely, although\\nnot always irreparably, and with a fair bit of individual idiosyncrasy.\\nApart from that, if there was someone out there who was perfect,\\nthey would take one look at you and run away screaming. Unless you\\nare deceiving someone, why would you end up with anyone better\\nthan you? You should be truly terrified if you have been accepted as a\\ndate. A sensible person would think of their new potential romantic\\npartner: “Oh, my God! You are either blind, desperate, or as\\ndamaged as me!” That is a horrifying idea—signing up with someone\\nwho is as at least as much trouble as you. It is by no means as bad as\\nbeing alone with yourself, but it is still out of the frying pan and into\\nthe fire—and at least the fire might transform you. Thus, you get\\nmarried, if you have any courage—if you have any long-term vision\\nand ability to vow and adopt responsibility; if you have any maturity\\n—and you start to transform the two of you into one reasonable\\nperson. And it is even the case that participating in such a dubious\\nprocess makes the two of you into one reasonable person with the\\npossibility of some growth. So, you talk. About everything. No matter\\nhow painful. And you make peace. And you thank providence if you\\nmanage it, because strife is the default condition.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThere was not much point in this chapter in talking about romance\\nimmediately—at least not about its maintenance. Romance is play,\\nand play does not take place easily when problems of any sort arise.\\nPlay requires peace, and peace requires negotiation. And you are\\nlucky even then if you get to play.\\n\\nThe issue of marital romance—intimacy and sex—is a complex\\none, with a dragon lurking under every question. For example: What\\ndo you owe each other sexually if you are entangled in a marriage?\\nThe answer is not “no sex.” That is not the answer, because part of\\n\\n\\x0cthe contractual arrangement is to organize your romantic life in a\\nmutually satisfactory manner. It is an implicit precondition for the\\nstability of the marriage. It is probably not sex fifteen times a day,\\nand it is probably not sex begrudgingly once a year. It is somewhere\\nbetween extremes, and that is where you must begin to negotiate.\\n\\nMy observation has been that the typical adult couple—when they\\n\\nhave a job, children, and the domestic economy we just discussed,\\nand all that worry and responsibility and concern—might manage\\nonce or twice a week, or even three times a week (not likely), for a\\nreasonable romantic interlude. That frequency, if handled well,\\nseems to work out acceptably for both partners. I have observed that\\ntwice is better than once, but once is much better than zero. Zero is\\nbad. If you go to zero, then one of you is tyrannizing the other, and\\nthe other is submitting. If you go to zero, then one of you is going to\\nhave an affair—physical, emotional, fantastical, or some combination\\nof the three. I do not say that lightly. Something has to give, and\\nthere has to be a no there, somewhere, when the romance disappears\\nand the frequency of sexual intimacy hits rock bottom; there has to\\nbe a strong indication that “that is not good enough.” I am not\\nrecommending the affair, but that is what you are setting yourself up\\nfor if your sex life vanishes. Maybe you want to take that pathway\\nand facilitate the affair because you want to play the martyr: “My\\nwife left me to have an affair, and poor me.” And why did she do such\\na thing? “Well, perhaps our sex life was not all it could have been”\\n(and this is an answer that may require a fair bit of digging). “What\\nexactly do you mean by ‘was not all it could have been’?” “Well, we\\nhad not made love for two years, and she went and had an affair.”\\nThat is not a shock. You should begin by assuming that your\\npartner is a relatively normal human being, and that there is a\\ncertain amount of sexual satisfaction that is a reasonable\\nrequirement—let us say twice a week, or once a week, under\\nconditions of intense busyness. In the early days of marriage it might\\nbe no problem to express romantic interest in your partner, but there\\nis so much that must be done to live. Dating is a pain, even if you are\\nsingle. I am perfectly aware that there is adventure there, too, but a\\nlot of that occurs in movies, and not on internet dating sites, in text\\nexchanges, coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, where the first\\nawkward encounters occur. You really have to work at it, and you\\nwill, if you are single, because you are lonesome, starved for\\n\\n\\x0cattention, and desperate for physical intimacy. (Single people have\\nfar less sex, on average, than married people, although I suppose that\\na small percentage are making out like bandits. But I cannot see that\\neven those successful in that manner are doing themselves any\\nfavors.)\\n\\nSo, as a single person, you will work at dating, because you are\\nlonesome and deprived, but it is no simple matter. You must make\\nspace in your life for it. You have to plan. You must use your\\nimagination, spend money, find an acceptable dating partner, and, as\\nthey say, kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince (or to find a princess, as\\nwell). People are often relieved when they get married, because they\\ndo not have to make all that so often counterproductive effort\\nanymore. But that does not at all mean that you are now off the\\nhook; that you can just lay back in your worn white underwear and\\nsocks and assume that all the hypothetical pleasures of Hugh Hefner\\nare going to automatically manifest themselves in your household.\\nThere is still plenty of effort required, unless you want the romance\\nto vanish. You have to talk about it. You have to have the difficult and\\nembarrassing conversation: “What is it going be, dear? Tuesday and\\nThursday? Wednesday and Friday? Monday and Saturday?” You\\nthink, “Oh, God. That is so cut and dried. That is so mundane and\\nplanned. That is so scheduled, predictable, bourgeois, antiromantic,\\nand robotic. It is demeaning and constricting, and it just turns sex\\ninto a duty. Where is the fun? Where is the spontaneity, the light\\njazz, cocktails, and excitement of sudden unexpected attraction?\\nWhere is the tuxedo and the little black dress?” That is what you\\nexpect? Even unconsciously, in your foolish fantasies? How often did\\nyou manage that when you were dating? Ever? And (remember, we\\nare adults talking here) you want two jobs (two careers, two\\nincomes), two kids, a reasonable standard of living—and\\nspontaneity? And you are not about to “settle” for anything less?\\n\\nGood luck with that. It is not going to happen—not in my clinical\\n\\n(and personal) experience—not without a lot of effort. What will\\nhappen is that the absolute necessities of life will inexorably start to\\ntake priority over the desirable necessities. Maybe there is a list of\\nten things you will do in a day, and sex is number eleven. It is not\\nthat you do not think sex is important, but you do not ever get past\\nnumber five on the list of ten. You must make space and time, and,\\nas far as I can tell, you have to do it consciously. You might think,\\n\\n\\x0c“What would it be like to spend some time with this person I was\\nonce romantically attracted to?” You have to think that through.\\nMaybe you only have time to watch half an hour of a TV show before\\nyou hop into bed. Maybe you have an hour and a half, or an hour,\\nbecause life is too hectic. It would not be too bad an idea to have a\\nshower. A little lipstick—that could be good. Some perfume. Some\\nclothing that is attractive and erotic. Buy some lingerie for your wife,\\nif you are a man, and wear it, with some courage, if you are a woman.\\nMaybe you, if you are a man, can find something to wear that is\\nreasonably sexy in a men’s shop or a place that sells erotic clothing\\nthat is not too extreme and does not scream of poor taste and\\nproduce intense and counterproductive self-consciousness. And a\\ncompliment or two when all that courage is manifested is not such a\\nbad idea. Maybe each time it happens for a year. You are trying to\\nbuild some confidence. Try some nice soft lighting—maybe some\\ncandles (and someone has to buy the candles, and should be\\nencouraged to do so; and the cynicism should be kept to an absolute\\nminimum, if you do not want to banish what is fragile out of\\nexistence altogether). Here is a rule: do not ever punish your partner\\nfor doing something you want them to continue doing. Particularly if\\nit took some real courage—some real going above and beyond the call\\nof duty—to manage.\\n\\nHow about trying to set up the whole situation in the romantic\\nmanner that you might imagine, if you were imagining having an\\naffair, because that is the sort of thing that people imagine when they\\nimagine an affair (if they have any imagination). Try having an affair\\nwith your wife or husband. Maybe the latter can set up the bedroom\\nwhile the former is preparing in the bathroom. We already\\nmentioned candles. How about some music? How about making sure\\nthat the room is clean and—God willing—aesthetically attractive?\\nThat might be a start. And maybe, the two you of will not get old and\\nfat, unhealthy and hypochondriacal as fast as possible just to spite\\neach other, which many couples certainly do. And then, maybe, you\\ncould both have what you need, and maybe even what you want. But\\nyou would have to admit your desires, and you would have to\\nnegotiate with your partner. What do you like? What does she like?\\nAnd are you going to let each other know? Are you going to risk\\npracticing badly? Are you going to learn some new tricks, even if you\\nfeel like a fool when you first try?\\n\\n\\x0cNone of this is easy. People will do things with or to each other\\nthat they will not talk about with each other, which is not helpful if\\nthey are married. It could be, maybe, if you were in a trading mood\\nand approaching this with goodwill, that you could decide what you\\nneed and want, and arrange exactly the right trade. You might ask\\nyourself, “Look, how do I have to set this up so I am likely to\\ncontinue being romantically interested in my wife or my husband for\\nthe next twenty years, so that I do not wander off and do something\\nstupid, like so many people do? What is my minimal precondition for\\nerotic satisfaction?” You might try to convince yourself that it is not\\nnecessary; that you can put up with what you have, even if it is\\nnothing. But you cannot. Not if you have any self-respect or sense.\\nThere is something that you are going to want and need. It is possible\\nthat, if you communicate openly what that something is, and at the\\nsame time leave yourself open to the same communication coming\\nfrom your partner, that you both could get not only what you want\\nfrom each other, but even more than you expect.\\n\\nArrange some dates, and then practice making those dates and\\ngoing on them until you are expert at it. Negotiate, and practice that,\\ntoo. Allow yourself to become aware of what you want and need, and\\nhave the decency to let your partner in on the secret. After all, who\\nelse are you going to tell? Devote yourself to the higher ideal upon\\nwhich an honest and courageous relationship is necessarily\\ndependent, and do that with the seriousness that will keep your soul\\nintact. Maintain your marital vows, so that you are desperate enough\\nto negotiate honestly. Do not let your partner brush you off with\\nprotestations of ignorance or refusal to communicate. Do not be\\nnaive, and do not expect the beauty of love to maintain itself without\\nall-out effort on your part. Distribute the requirements of your\\nhousehold in a manner you both find acceptable, and do not\\ntyrannize or subject yourself to slavery. Decide what you need to\\nkeep yourself satisfied both in bed and out of it. And maybe—just\\nmaybe—you will maintain the love of your life and you will have a\\nfriend and confidant, and this cold rock we live on at the far end of\\nthe cosmos will be a little warmer and more comforting than it would\\notherwise be. And you are going to need that, because rough times\\nare always on their way, and you better have something to set against\\nthem or despair will visit and will not depart.\\n\\n\\x0cPlan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your\\n\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nDO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BECOME\\nRESENTFUL, DECEITFUL, OR ARROGANT\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nYou have your reasons for being resentful, deceitful, and arrogant.\\nYou face, or will face, terrible, chaotic forces, and you will sometimes\\nbe outmatched. Anxiety, doubt, shame, pain, and illness, the agony\\nof conscience, the soul-shattering pit of grief, dashed dreams and\\ndisappointment, the reality of betrayal, subjection to the tyranny of\\nsocial being, and the ignominy of aging unto death—how could you\\nnot degenerate, and rage, and sin, and come to hate even hope itself?\\nI want you to know how you might resist that decline, that\\ndegeneration into evil. To do so—to understand your own personality\\nand its temptation by darkness—you need to know what you are up\\nagainst. You need to understand your motivations for evil—and the\\ntriad of resentment, deceit, and arrogance is as good a\\ndecomposition of what constitutes evil as I have been able to\\nformulate.\\n\\nIs it possible to understand the world in a manner that provides\\nprotection against the temptation to traverse that lowest of roads? It\\nis an axiom of human wisdom that clearer formulation and deeper\\ncomprehension of a problem is salutary. We will begin just that\\nattempt with a conceptual shift—one that is difficult and perplexing\\nfor the committed materialists we moderns are. First, a question:\\nWhat is the world made of? To answer this, we will need to consider\\nreality—the world—as it is fully experienced by someone alive and\\nawake, with all the richness of subjective being left intact—dreams,\\nsensory experiences, feelings, drives, and fantasies. This is the world\\n\\n\\x0cthat manifests itself to—or, better, that you meet head-on with—your\\nunique individual consciousness.\\n\\nConsider the act of awakening in the morning. If you were asked\\nwhat you perceive, at that moment, you might well mention the same\\nconcrete objects that anyone else might see, if they woke up in bed\\nbeside you. You might describe all that you have gathered around\\nyou in your bedroom—the desk, the chairs, the clothes (messy or\\nneatly arrayed, depending on your temperament and preference and,\\nperhaps, your condition last night). You are likely to answer in this\\nvery objective, realistic manner, claiming, essentially, to see the\\nfurniture of the stage. There is, of course, some truth to your answer,\\nalthough you may pay less attention to the familiar things around\\nyou than you think. Why waste time and energy perceiving what you\\ncan simply remember?\\n\\nHowever, the furniture and other contents of your bedroom are\\nnot truly what you perceive when you first wake up. You are already\\nfamiliar with the place where you sleep, and what it contains. There\\nis no reason to continue to effortfully and consciously apprehend\\nwhat you already understand. Instead, you are liable to perceive your\\nsurroundings psychologically. You begin to consider how you are\\ngoing to conduct yourself on the stage you will inevitably occupy, and\\nwhat is going to happen in consequence. What you see upon waking\\nis an array of possibilities, many of them concerning the day at hand,\\nand others associated with the weeks, months, and years to come.\\nWhat you are truly concerned with upon waking is the answer to a\\nquestion: “What shall I make of the possibilities that I see in play in\\nfront of me, complex, worrisome, exciting, dull, restricted, unlimited,\\nfortunate, or catastrophic as they may be?”\\n\\nOut there in the potential is everything you could have. It is the\\n\\nrealm of unrealized possibility, and no one knows its full extent.\\nThere appears to be no limit, in principle, to what can be made from\\nwhat has not yet manifested itself. Everything that might yet be\\nmakes its home there. You could well consider what remains to be\\nencountered as an eternal treasure house—a horn of plenty (which\\nare in fact two of its representations). But that is only half the story\\n(and there is the rub). If the potential you confront manifests\\nimproperly (because of a mistake on your part; because of the sheer\\narbitrariness of the world), then you can find yourself in terrible\\ntrouble. Out there, in the unknown—in the future, which is what you\\n\\n\\x0ctruly contend with, when your consciousness reawakens—awaits\\neverything good, but also everything terrible, painful, hellish, and\\ndeadly. Whatever potential might be, therefore, it does not follow the\\nsimple rules of material logic. Objects that play by the rules of the\\ngame we consider real (when we assume that what is real is also\\nlogical) can only be one thing at a time, and certainly not themselves\\nand their opposite, simultaneously. Potential, however, is not like\\nthat. It is not categorizable in that manner. It is tragedy, comedy,\\ngood and evil, and everything in between at the same time. It is also\\nnot tangible, in the sense that the things we consider must be\\ntangible. It does not even exist—except as what could be exists.\\nPerhaps it is best considered as the structure of reality, before reality\\nmanifests itself concretely in the present, where reality appears to\\nmost self-evidently exist. But creatures such as us do not contend\\nwith the present. It may therefore be that it is not the present that is\\nmost real—at least as far as our consciousness is concerned. We have\\nto fight to “be here now,” the advice of the sages. Left to our own\\ndevices, we turn our minds instead to investigating the future: What\\ncould be? Attempting to answer that question—that is life. That is the\\ntrue encounter with reality. What is? That is the dead past, already\\naccomplished. What could be? That is the emergence of new being,\\nnew adventure, brought about by the conjunction of living\\nconsciousness with the great expanse of paradoxical possibility.\\n\\nAnd if it is possibility that is most real, rather than actuality (as\\nevidenced by the fact that it is possibility we are destined to contend\\nwith), then it is the investigation into possibility that is the most\\nimportant of all investigations. But how do we investigate something\\nthat is not here, or there, or anywhere? How do we examine what has\\nnot yet manifested itself; explore what only could be but is not yet?\\nAnd how can we possibly communicate with each other intelligibly\\nabout that attempt, trade information about the most effective\\nconceptualizations, approaches, and strategies? The answer to that,\\nas far as I can tell, is by communicating through stories about what is\\nand, equally, what could be. And what that implies is that if\\npossibility is the ultimate element of reality with which we contend,\\nthen it is stories that hold the wisdom that we most need to know.\\n\\nWe naturally think of our lives as stories, and communicate about\\n\\nour experience in that same manner. We tell people automatically\\nwhere we are (to set the stage) and where we are going, so that we\\n\\n\\x0ccan create the present out of the possibility that springs forth as we\\njourney toward our destination. No one finds such an account out of\\nthe ordinary. But we are doing more than portraying our lives, and\\nthose of others, as a sequence of events. It is something deeper than\\nthat. When you depict a person’s actions in the world, you describe\\nhow they perceive, evaluate, think, and act—and, when you do so, a\\nstory unfolds (and the better you are at such descriptions, the more\\nstorylike your accounts are). Furthermore, we experience the world\\nas populated by figures that represent exactly what we must contend\\nwith. The unknown, unexpected, and novel—the world of possibility\\n—is represented in dramatic form, as is the world that we expect and\\nstrive to bring into being, and ourselves, as actors faced with the\\nunknown and the predictable alike. We use the story to represent all\\nof this.\\n\\nCould it be that we communicate in stories (and everyone else\\nunderstands them) because what everyone is doing in the world is\\nfundamentally a story? Could that mean that the world of experience\\nis, in truth, indistinguishable from a story—that it cannot be\\nrepresented in a manner more accurate than that of the story? We\\nare, in principle, adapted to the world—adapted to its realities. Thus,\\nif we naturally construe the world as a story, then perhaps the world\\nis most accurately, or at least most practically, construed as a story\\n(and accurate and practical are not so easy to distinguish). You\\nmight argue, contrarily, that the scientific view of the world is more\\naccurate, in some sense, and that the scientific view is not\\nfundamentally a story. But, as far as I can tell, it is still nested inside\\na story: one that goes something like “careful and unbiased pursuit of\\nthe truth will make the world a better place for all people, reducing\\nsuffering, extending life, and producing wealth.” Why practice\\nscience otherwise? Why would anyone take on the difficulties and\\nrigors of scientific training without that motivation? There are more\\neffective ways of making money, for example, if you have the\\nintelligence and discipline to become a genuine researcher. And in\\nterms of intrinsic motivation, the love of science is not precisely\\ndisinterested learning. The great experimenters and scientific writers\\nI have known are passionate about their pursuit. Something\\nemotional drives them. They hope that their learning (disinterested\\nthough it may be, as at present it has no specific aim except that of\\nlearning) will have some genuinely positive outcome: making the\\n\\n\\x0cworld a better place. That provides the entire pursuit with a narrative\\nelement, the motive that accompanies any good plot, and the\\ntransformation of character that makes up the best of stories.\\n\\nWe conceptualize what we experience as a story. That story is,\\nroughly speaking, the description of the place we are at right now, as\\nwell as the place that we are going to, the strategies and adventures\\nthat we implement and experience along the way, and our downfalls\\nand reconstitutions during that journey. You perceive and act inside\\na structure like that all the time, because you are always somewhere,\\ngoing somewhere else, and you are always evaluating where you are\\nand what is going on in relation to your goal. Part of this thinking in\\nstories is our tendency to see the world as a selection of characters,\\neach of which represents either where we are or are going, the\\nunexpected occurrences we may encounter, or ourselves as actors.\\nWe see animated intent everywhere1—and we certainly present the\\nworld that way to our children. That is why Thomas the Tank Engine\\nhas a face and a smile, and the sun has a face and a smile. That is\\nwhy—even among adults—there is a man in the moon, and deities\\nscattered across the stars. Everything is animated. That is a reflection\\nof our proclivity to treat things as if they are personalities with\\nintent, regardless of what they are, regardless of whether they are\\nanimate or inanimate. That is why it is okay with you that your car\\nhas a face (on the front, where faces belong), which it most certainly\\ndoes.\\n\\nWe act (perceive, think, react) that way because each member of\\n\\nthe human species does almost everything he or she does in the\\npresence, for better or worse, of other people. And that has been the\\ncase forever. Virtually everything we encountered in the long\\nbiological rise to our current form was social. If we were not\\ninteracting with people, then it was with animals. Maybe we were\\nhunting them, or herding them, or playing with them, once they had\\nbeen domesticated—or maybe they were hunting us, and we had to\\nunderstand them to escape them or defend ourselves. All that tribal,\\nintertribal, and cross-species interaction molded our brains, shaped\\nour fundamental categories, rendering them social, not objective—\\nnot like the categories of science. It is not as if we are born with an\\ninstinct for the periodic table of the elements. No. We only managed\\nto get that straight a few hundred years ago, and it took a lot of\\nconscious time and effort to formulate. Furthermore, even though it\\n\\n\\x0cwas other people who did the terribly hard work necessary to\\nestablish that remarkable chemical category system, it is difficult to\\nlearn. It is not that interesting, intrinsically (at least for most\\npeople), because there is no story associated with it. It is an accurate\\nand useful representation of the objective reality of what is, beyond\\nthe shadow of a doubt, but it is a struggle to master perception of\\nthat abstracted sort.\\n\\nConversely, if someone is telling you a story, it attracts your\\nattention immediately. It can be a complicated and cognitively\\ndifficult story—something requiring hours of concentration. It might\\neven be the story of how the periodic table of the elements was\\ndiscovered, and the triumphs and difficulties that accompanied the\\nprocess. It does not matter. If it is well told, it is gripping, and likely\\nto be remembered. If you want to teach a child something and get\\nthem to attend, tell them a story. They will repeatedly ask you to do\\nthat. They do not grab your pant leg and beg, “Dad, one more line\\nfrom the periodic table of the elements before bed!” But they are\\nhighly motivated to hear a story—sometimes even the same one\\nevery night. That is an indication of the depth and importance of\\nstories. You might think the story is simple, but your child, listening\\nintently, is processing the multiple levels of meaning represented in\\nany decent tale—meanings of which you are very unlikely to be\\naware, if the story you are telling is traditional and deep.\\n\\nWe are all human. That means there is something about our\\nexperience that is the same. Otherwise, we would not all be human.\\nWe would not even be able to communicate. To communicate,\\nparadoxically, there must be things about you and others that can go\\nwithout saying. Imagine telling someone, “I got really angry this\\nmorning.” If there is any indication you want the conversation to\\ncontinue and they are agreeable, they might ask you why; but they\\nare not likely to ask you, “What do you mean, ‘angry’?” They do not\\nask the latter question because they already know, from their own\\nexperience, what “angry” means. It can be assumed, rather than\\nexplained. In fact, the only reason you can talk about anything at all\\nis because there are some things you do not ever have to talk about.\\nYou can just take them for granted. We know, worldwide, for\\nexample, that there are basic sets of emotions shared by all humans\\n—and by many animals.2 Everyone understands a growling mother\\nbear standing in front of her cubs, teeth bared for all to see. It is\\n\\n\\x0cthose things that you do not have to talk about that most precisely\\nmake us human, that constitute the essence, mutable though it\\nremains through the actions of society and environment.\\n\\nSo, on to the story—to the story of the story, in fact. We will begin\\nby meeting the characters whose existence universally structures our\\nunderstanding of the potential of the world. And, with luck, as you\\nmeet them, you will begin to understand their relationship to\\nresentment, arrogance, and deceit well enough so that understanding\\nwill offer you some protection.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\nWhen my son, Julian, was about four years old, he watched the\\nmovie Pinocchio obsessively—particularly the sequence that portrays\\nthe whale, Monstro, transforming into a fire-breathing dragon. He\\nmust have seen it fifty times. And it was not obvious that he enjoyed\\nit. He was clearly afraid of the climactic scene. I could see it on his\\nface. He had good reason for his fear. The characters he had come to\\nidentify with had laid it all on the line. There was a strong motif of\\ndanger and sacrifice. Nonetheless, it was the scene that fascinated\\nhim the most.\\n\\nWhat in the world was he doing, watching the film repeatedly?\\nParticularly if the emotion it produced was fear? Why would a child\\nvoluntarily subject himself to that? Julian was using all the faculties\\nof his newly forming mind, rational and unconscious alike, to process\\nthe relationships in such a tale. Pinocchio and tales like it are dense,\\nlayered, and complex in ways that seize the imagination of children\\nand will not let go. That is not accidental. Kids are small and young\\nand, in some ways, they do not know anything, because they have\\nvery little personal experience. But they are also very ancient\\ncreatures, in another manner, and by no means stupid or inattentive.\\nThe fact that they are gripped by fairy tales and stories like Pinocchio\\nis an indication of just how much depth children perceive in those\\nstories, even if you, as an adult observer, do not notice it anymore.\\n\\nThat whale is the Dragon of Chaos. This is the symbolic\\n\\nrepresentation of potential, of possibility, for better and for worse.\\n\\n\\x0cRepresentations of this figure appear everywhere, and children see\\nthem, even if they have no idea what those figures mean. In the\\nDisney classic Sleeping Beauty, for example, the Evil Queen,\\nMaleficent, entraps Prince Phillip. She chains him in her castle\\ndungeon and tells him a charming fairy tale of sorts. She delights in\\ndescribing to him the ruined and ancient man he will be, six or seven\\ndecades in the future, when she deigns to release him from his cell.\\nShe portrays him as nothing but the parody of a hero, and has a fine\\ntime doing so, locking the door to his prison cell on her departure,\\nclimbing the stairs back to her palace, laughing evilly all the while.\\nShe is the classic devouring Oedipal mother, preventing her son from\\nmanifesting his destiny by refusing to allow him to leave home.\\n\\nThe prince escapes from the dungeon, with the help of the positive\\n\\nfeminine: three helpful fairies, who are clearly the mythical\\ncounterparts to Maleficent. The Evil Queen sees him mount his horse\\nand make his dangerous way through her army, across her\\ncrumbling, quickly closing drawbridges, and down the road leading\\noutside the would-be death trap of her castle. With ever-increasing\\ndismay, she leaps from turret to turret, until she makes her way to\\nthe uppermost place. There she stands, enraged, calling up the fires\\nof hell themselves, and transforms herself into a gigantic, fire-\\nbreathing dragon. Everyone viewing the movie accepts that as a\\ngiven: “Of course the Evil Queen turns into a dragon. There is no\\nproblem with that.” Why, exactly, is that universally acceptable? On\\nthe face of it, the transformation makes no sense at all. One moment,\\nshe is standing, a perfectly understandable although exceedingly\\nirritated Evil Queen. Next, she spins around a few times and—poof!—\\nshe is a gigantic fire-breathing reptile. Perhaps you are all thinking as\\nyou read this, “Why are you making an issue of this? Even my four-\\nyear-old understands that!” I do not have a problem with an Evil\\nQueen turning into a dragon. It is so self-evident that it can happen\\neven in the middle of a popular movie and be accepted at face value—\\nso self-evident that it is very difficult to draw people’s attention to\\nthe idea that something very strange has happened.\\n\\nHowever, if Queen Elizabeth II suddenly turned into a giant fire-\\n\\nbreathing lizard in the midst of one of her endless galas, a certain\\namount of consternation would be both appropriate and expected.\\nPeople—even monarchs of a great kingdom—do not just transform\\ninto dangerous reptiles and attack their guests (well, not at most\\n\\n\\x0cparties). But if it happens within the context of a story, then we\\naccept it. That does not explain the mystery, however. Not just any\\nold transformation can happen within a story. It would not have\\nmade any sense if Maleficent had donned a sparkly pink outfit and\\nbegun to cast roses on the pathway Prince Phillip galloped down to\\nescape his confinement. That was not in Maleficent’s nature, nor in\\nthe set of narrative expectations that every audience implicitly brings\\nto every movie (and is unlikely to appreciate having disrupted, unless\\ndone with exceptional finesse and higher-order purpose). But it is no\\nproblem for her to become a dragon. Why? It is partly because\\nnature can and constantly does revert from her dangerous but still\\nunderstandable guise into total chaos. This happens, for example,\\nwhen the campfire we just built to cook our hot dogs and sit around\\nsinging campfire songs catches a sudden gust of hot, dry air and the\\nlong-parched forest hypothetically sheltering our tents ignites into a\\nraging inferno. Dangers we can handle can suddenly turn themselves\\ninto dangers we cannot handle. That is why it is no surprise to\\nanyone when the Evil Queen becomes the Dragon of Chaos.\\n\\nImagine, for a moment, that you are a prehistoric protohuman\\nbeing. You are camped for the night, and that site is defined territory\\n—safety and predictability, for the time. Your friends are there, your\\ntribal kin. You have your spears. You have your fire. It is safe—or at\\nleast what passes for safe under such conditions. But if you carelessly\\nwander a mere two hundred feet away from the campfire, then\\nsomething horrible with teeth and scales eats you. That is what is out\\nthere in the terrible unknown. That idea is deeply embedded inside\\nof us. We know that human beings are innately afraid of reptilian\\npredators, for example—and that there is good reason for that. It is\\nnot merely that we are prepared to learn fear of them (which we\\ncertainly are): the fear itself is innate.3 For all intents and purposes,\\nthere is an image that exists inside of us of the terrible hunter that\\nlurks in the night. That is why children become afraid of the dark\\nonce they are old enough to move around by themselves.4 “There is a\\nmonster in the dark, Dad!” they insist, at nighttime. And Dad assures\\nhis son or daughter that there is no such thing as a monster. Well,\\nthe adult is wrong, and the child is exactly right. There might not be a\\nmonster in that particular section of the dark, right now, but that is\\nof small comfort when you are three feet high and tasty, and there\\ncould be—will be—a monster there in the future. That is why it might\\n\\n\\x0cbe of more use to let your child know directly and through your own\\nactions that there is always something sinister and dangerous in the\\ndark, and that it is the job of the well-prepared individual to confront\\nit and take the treasure it archetypally guards. It is something that an\\nadult and child can act out with great results.\\n\\nAbout a year and a half before his encounter with Pinocchio, I took\\n\\nJulian to the Boston Science Museum. There was a Tyrannosaurus\\nrex skeleton there. It was impressively large, as far as I was\\nconcerned. But it was even larger, from his perspective. He would\\nnot get closer than 100 feet. At 150 feet, his curiosity drove him\\nforward. But things came to a stop when we got closer. That was a\\nneurological phenomenon, too. His curiosity drove him forward,\\ntoward the monster, so he could collect some useful information—\\nuntil the fear froze him. I could see exactly where that boundary lay.\\nMaybe it defined how far away he would need to be to remain safe if\\nthat thing suddenly whipped its head around to grab him.\\n\\nThere is an idea embedded deep within the human psyche that\\n\\npotential can be a place of maximal horror, home to an infinite\\npredator—or an infinite variety of predators. Practically speaking, it\\nis true, as human beings have been prey animals since the beginning\\nof time, although we made it very difficult for the predators once we\\neffectively armed and banded together. (Personally, I am happy\\nabout that. I have camped where the grizzly bears were plentiful. It is\\nnice that they are on the planet and all that, but I prefer my grizzlies\\nshy, not too hungry, and far enough away to be picturesque.) But\\nthere are spiritual and psychological forces operating in a predatory\\nmanner that can destroy you, as well—and they can present an even\\ngreater danger. The malevolence in the heart of people that makes\\nthem criminal falls into that category, as does the evil that drives the\\ntotalitarian war of revenge, rapine, greed, or sheer love of blood and\\ndestruction. And that malevolence also exists in your heart, and that\\nis the greatest dragon of all—just as mastering that malevolence\\nconstitutes the greatest and unlikeliest of individual achievements.\\n\\nYou are built, neurologically, to interpret the world in this\\n\\ndramatic manner, at a very deep level. An ancient part of your brain\\nknown as the hypothalamus5—a small region, sitting atop the spinal\\ncord—regulates many of the fundamental responses that find their\\nexpression in the conceptualization of danger and potential. One of\\nits two modules is responsible for self-preservation (hunger, thirst,\\n\\n\\x0cand, most important for our purposes, defensive aggression in the\\nface of threat) as well as reproduction (sexual arousal and basic\\nsexual behavior). The second is responsible for exploration.* Half of\\nthe hypothalamus drives our use of what has been explored\\npreviously to quell and satisfy the basic demands of life, including\\nour capability to protect ourselves in the case of attack. The other\\nhalf is always asking, What is out there? What could it be used for?\\nHow might it be dangerous? What are its habits? So, what is the\\nstory? Eat, drink, and be merry, until the provisions run out—but\\nwatch out, always, for the monsters. Then venture out into the\\ndangerous but promising unknown world and discover what is there.\\nWhy? Well, you already know a lot of things you need to know,\\nalthough you do not know nearly enough. You understand that,\\nbecause life is not as good as it could be, and because you are going\\nto die. Obviously, under such conditions, you should learn more. So,\\nyou are driven to explore. The fundamental representation of reality,\\nas an eternal treasure house guarded by an eternal predator, is\\ntherefore a perfect representation of the way you are wired to react to\\nthe world at the most fundamental depths of your Being.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nWe all have an image of nature. It might be an image akin to a\\nbeautiful landscape—nature as benevolent and renewing. It is an\\nimage of that kind that grounds the sentimental environmentalist\\nview of the world. Being from Northern Alberta, I do not share\\nexactly the same view of nature, since up in my hometown of\\nFairview nature was constantly conspiring either to freeze its\\ninhabitants to death for six months of the year, and to devour them\\nwith insects for at least two more. So that is the less romantic part of\\nnature, which is red in tooth and claw. That is the part of nature that\\nis associated with injury, disease, death, insanity, and everything else\\nthat can and will befall you, as a biological creature, on the negative\\nend of the continuum.\\n\\nThere is the potential of the future that has not yet been\\ntransformed into reality (represented, as we have seen, by the\\nDragon of Chaos). But then there is the nature you encounter directly\\nin your life, and which cannot be considered absolutely unknown.\\n\\n\\x0cThere is the benevolence of nature: the fact that you are here, alive—\\nand sometimes happy; the fact that there is delicious food to eat, and\\nattractive, interesting people to interact with, and no shortage of\\nfascinating things to see and do. There are amazing vistas of\\nlandscape. There is the beauty and immortality and immensity of the\\nocean. There is all the bountiful, wondrous element of natural Being.\\nBut there is also the absolute horror that goes along with that:\\ndestruction, disease, suffering, and death. Those two elements of\\nexperience exist side by side. It is even the case that the former could\\nnot exist without the latter: even within your own body, healthy as it\\nmay be, a very delicate balance between the death of every cell that\\nhas outlasted its utility and the new life that springs forward to\\nreplace it is a prerequisite for your continued existence.\\n\\nBoth these elements of existence manifest themselves in our\\n\\nimagination in personified form. One is the Evil Queen, the Goddess\\nof Destruction and Death; the other is her positive counterpart, the\\nFairy Godmother, the benevolent monarch, the young and loving\\nmother watching with infinite care over her helpless charge. To live\\nproperly, you need to be acquainted with both these figures. If you\\nare a child, abused by your mother, familiar only with the Evil\\nQueen, then you are damaged by the absence of love, stunted by lack\\nof attention, and arbitrarily subject to fear and pain and aggression.\\nThat is no way to live, and it is very difficult to grow up functional\\nand capable and void of distrust, hate, and the desire, say, for\\nrevenge. You need to find someone to act the part of the Benevolent\\nQueen: a friend, a family member, a fictional character—or a part of\\nyour own psyche, motivated by knowing that your mistreatment is\\nwrong, swearing to take any opportunity that comes your way to\\nescape your misfortunate circumstances, leave them behind, and\\nbalance your life appropriately. Maybe the first step in this direction\\nis to posit, despite your mistreatment, that you are in fact worthy of\\ncare; and the second step is to give it, where you can, despite\\nreceiving tragically little yourself.\\n\\nIf you understand the polarity of nature, its terror and\\n\\nbenevolence, you recognize two fundamental elements of experience,\\npermanent, eternal, and unavoidable, and you can begin to\\nunderstand, for example, the profound pull toward sacrifice. It is a\\nreligious trope that sacrifices keep the gods happy, and coming to\\nunderstand just who the unhappy gods are, so to speak, and just how\\n\\n\\x0cterrible they are when they are unhappy is a genuine step toward\\nwisdom—a genuine and humbling step. Modern people have a hard\\ntime understanding what sacrifice means, because they think, for\\nexample, of a burnt offering on an altar, which is an archaic way of\\nacting out the idea. But we have no problem at all when we\\nconceptualize sacrifice psychologically, because we all know you\\nmust forgo gratification in the present to keep the wolf from the door\\nin the future. So, you offer something to the negative goddess, so that\\nthe positive one shows up. You train long, difficult hours to be a\\nnurse or a physician or a social worker. That sacrificial attitude is in\\nfact the great discovery of the future, conjoined with the ability to\\nnegotiate and bargain and cope with that future—abandon impulsive\\ngratification; let go of something you need and want; obtain\\nsomething valuable in the long run in consequence (and keep the\\nhorror at bay). You forgo the partying and the easy hours. You\\nimmerse yourself, instead, in the difficulties of life. You do that so\\nthat fewer of those difficulties will manifest themselves—for yourself,\\nemployed gainfully as you will become, and for all the others you will\\nhelp as the strength you developed through proper sacrifice makes\\nitself manifest. We are always bargaining in that manner. We act out\\nthe belief that we can strike a bargain with the structure of reality.\\nStrangely enough, we often can. If you are sensible, you do that all\\nthe time. You prepare for the worst. You prepare for the arrival of the\\nEvil Queen. You do what you have to do, knowing about her\\nexistence, and you keep her at bay—in proportion to your wisdom\\nand in accordance with your luck. And if you succeed, Benevolent\\nNature smiles upon you—until she does not. But at least you have\\nsome control over the situation. You are not a sitting duck, or a babe\\nin the woods, or a rube at the amusement park—or at least no more\\nso than you have to be.\\n\\nNature is chaos, too, because it is always wreaking havoc with\\n\\nculture, its existential opposite—and the next subject of our\\ninvestigation. After all, as Robert Burns has it, “The best laid\\nschemes o’ Mice an’ Men / Gang aft a-gley.” And it is often nature in\\npositive and negative guise that does precisely that. It is no easy\\nmatter to balance the fragility of life and the necessity for procreation\\n(and all the uncertainty of pregnancy and birth and child-rearing)\\nwith the desire for certainty, predictability, and order. And this is to\\nsay nothing of death (and even cancer is, after all, just another form\\n\\n\\x0cof life). But all that is not to say, ever, that chaos is of less value than\\norder. There is nothing but sterility without unpredictability, even\\nthough a bit less unpredictability often seems eminently desirable.\\nThis nature/chaos combination is often seen in pop culture\\nrepresentations. As we mentioned, in the Disney movie Sleeping\\nBeauty, for example, there is an Evil Queen—just as there is in The\\nLittle Mermaid (Ursula), Snow White (Grimhilde), One Hundred\\nand One Dalmatians (Cruella de Vil), Cinderella (Lady Tremaine),\\nTangled (Mother Gothel), and Alice in Wonderland (the Queen of\\nHearts). She represents the harsh element of the natural world. The\\nexample of Sleeping Beauty is, once again, particularly germane.\\nRemember what happens at the movie’s opening. The king and\\nqueen have waited long, and are now desperate to have a baby. The\\nblessing arrives; the baby is born and they call her Aurora, the dawn.\\nThey are all thrilled, and so is the whole kingdom—properly so,\\nbecause new life has arrived. They plan a great christening party. It is\\na fine idea, but they fail to invite Maleficent, the Evil Queen, to the\\ncelebrations. And it is not ignorance that prevents them. They know\\nof her existence, and they are well acquainted with her power. It is\\nwillful blindness, and it is a bad move. They desire to shield their\\nnew and precious daughter from the negative element of the world,\\ninstead of determining how to provide her with the strength and\\nwisdom to prevail, despite the reality of the negative. All this does is\\nkeep Aurora naive and vulnerable. Maleficent shows up anyway, as\\nshe most certainly will, and there is a message in that: invite the Evil\\nQueen to your child’s life. If you fail to do so, your children will grow\\nup weak and in need of protection, and the Evil Queen is going to\\nmake herself known no matter what steps you take to stop her. At the\\nchristening, in fact, not only does she arrive, well behaved but\\nuninvited, but she offers a present (in the form of a curse): the death\\nof Aurora at the age of sixteen, brought about by the prick of the\\nspindle of a spinning wheel. And all that because she was not invited\\nto celebrate the young princess’s christening. Only because a\\ncompassionate and powerful guest intercedes—one of the three\\naforementioned fairies, representative of the positive feminine—is\\nthe curse transmuted from death into profound unconsciousness, a\\nstate barely less fatal.\\n\\nThat is what happens to those beauties, so to speak, who remain\\nfar too unawakened when they hit sixteen: They do not want to be\\n\\n\\x0cconscious, because they have not developed the courage and ability\\nto face the negative element of the natural world. Instead of being\\nencouraged, they have been sheltered. And if you shelter young\\npeople, you destroy them. You did not invite the Evil Queen, even for\\nshort visits. What are your children going to do when she shows up\\nin full force, if they are entirely unprepared? They are not going to\\nwant to live. They are going to long for unconsciousness. And it gets\\nworse. If you overprotect your kids, you become the very thing from\\nwhich you are trying to shelter them. Depriving them of their young\\nlives’ necessary adventures, you weaken their characters. You\\nbecome the Destroying Agent itself—the very witch that devours\\ntheir autonomous consciousness.\\n\\nI had a client many years ago who was a real-life version of\\nSleeping Beauty. She was tall, blonde haired, razor thin (as the\\nsaying goes), and profoundly unhappy. She was enrolled in a local\\njunior college, attempting to upgrade so that she could attend\\nuniversity. She came to see me because she did not want to live. She\\nalso did not want to die, really—at least not actively. Instead, she\\nattempted to keep herself unconscious with the use of Valium and its\\nvariants, including sleeping pills, which she procured in sufficient\\nquantities from her (several) physicians, who were no doubt\\noverworked enough not to keep track of exactly what she was doing.\\nShe managed to keep herself asleep fifteen or sixteen hours a day.\\nShe was smart and literate, and showed me a philosophy essay she\\nhad written on the pointlessness not only of her life but life in\\ngeneral. She was unable to tolerate the responsibility, by all\\nappearances, but also could not deal with the cruelty she saw\\neverywhere around her. She was a vegan, for example, and that was\\ndirectly associated with her acute physical terror of life. She was\\nunable even to enter the aisles of a supermarket where meat was\\ndisplayed. Where others saw the cuts they were going to prepare for\\ntheir family, she saw rows of dead body parts. That vision only served\\nto confirm her belief that life was, in essence, unbearable.\\n\\nHer biological mother had died in childbirth, and she was raised\\nby her father and her stepmother. The latter was a holy terror. I met\\nher only once, in my office, during what would have ordinarily been a\\nclinical session with her stepdaughter. She spent the entire hour\\nactively tearing strips off me: first for being of little use as a clinician,\\nand second for “no doubt” blaming everything that was wrong with\\n\\n\\x0cmy client on her (step)mothering. I do not think I got more than a\\ndozen words in edgewise. It was a remarkable performance, brought\\non, I believe, by my insistence that the phone calls she made two or\\nthree times a day to my client while the latter was away at school—\\nsome of which I heard in recordings—had to be reduced by a factor of\\nten, and certainly needed to be more pleasant. I am not saying and\\ndid not believe then that all this was the stepmother’s fault. I am sure\\nshe had her reasons to be frustrated. Her stepdaughter was not fully\\nengaged in life, by any means, and was an expensive four\\nunderperforming years into what should have been a two-year\\ncertificate. But it was clear that thrice-daily phone calls consisting\\nmostly of anger and insults were not adding to my client’s desire to\\nbe alive. I suggested that weekly phone calls should become the\\nnorm, and encouraged her to hang up if the conversation took a\\nwicked turn. She started to put that into practice, and I presumed all\\nthat contributed to her stepmother’s demand to meet and confront\\nme.\\n\\nSleeping Beauty described her childhood as idyllic. She said that\\nshe lived the life of a fairy-tale princess; an only child, the darling of\\nboth parents. But that all changed when she hit adolescence. Her\\nstepmother’s attitude changed from trust to deep distrust, and they\\nbegan the fights that continually characterized their relationship\\nfrom then on (she was in her early thirties when I met her). The\\nproblem of sex had reared its ugly head. The stepmother responded\\nby acting as if her innocent child had been replaced by a corrupt\\nimpostor; the stepdaughter responded by dating a series of ne’er-do-\\nwells whom at one level she probably thought she deserved (having\\nlost the perfect innocence of the child princess) and at another\\nconstituted the perfect punishment for her mother.\\n\\nTogether, we designed an exposure-training program to help her\\novercome her fear of life. We first undertook to visit a nearby butcher\\nshop. The shop owner and I had become friendly acquaintances over\\nthe years. After I explained my client’s situation to him (with her\\npermission), I asked if I could bring her into his store, show her the\\nmeat counter, and then—when she was ready—bring her to the back\\nto watch as his team cut up the carcasses that were delivered through\\nthe alleyway loading dock. He quickly agreed. Our initial goal was\\nmerely to get to the store together. I assured her that we could pause\\nat any time, or stop altogether, and that under no conditions would I\\n\\n\\x0ctrick, entice, or even cajole her into pushing her beyond what she\\ncould tolerate. During the first session, she managed to enter the\\nstore and place her hand on the display case. She did it shaking and\\nin visible tears (also no easy thing to manage in public), but she did\\nit. By the fourth session, she was able to watch the butchers use their\\nknives and saws on the large and still animal-like carcasses they were\\nslicing into the standard cuts they sold. There was no doubt that this\\nwas good for her. She was less inclined, for example, to medicate\\nherself into unconsciousness and more likely to attend classes. She\\nbecame tougher, harder, harsher—adjectives that are not always\\nmeant as compliments but are sometimes the precise antidote to too\\nmuch sentimentality, which is dangerously infantilizing. We also\\nmade arrangements for her to spend a weekend at a local farm where\\na few common barnyard animals were kept (pigs, horses, chickens,\\ngoats). I asked the farmer, who had also been a client of mine, to\\nallow her to accompany him while he attended to his livestock. A city\\ngirl to the core, my client knew nothing whatsoever about animals,\\nand tended, in consequence, to romanticize them, in exactly the\\nfairy-tale manner appropriate to the conditions of her childhood. Her\\ntwo-day sojourn in the country and her decision to observe the\\nanimals carefully helped her develop a much less romanticized\\nperception of the true nature of the animals we raise and dine upon.\\nThey are sentient beings, in part, and we have a responsibility not to\\ninflict any more suffering upon them than necessary, but they are not\\nhuman beings, and they are certainly not children. This needs to be\\nunderstood at an embodied level. Excess sentimentality is an illness,\\na developmental failure, and a curse to children and others who need\\nour care (but not too much of it).\\n\\nSleeping Beauty was a remarkable dreamer. I have had clients who\\nwould commonly remember two or three dreams a night, though not\\nalways in great detail. She not only remembered many dreams, but\\nremembered them fully, and she also often became lucid—conscious\\nof dreaming—while she slept. She was the only person I ever met\\nwho could ask her dream characters what they meant—symbolically\\nspeaking—or what message they had for her, and they would tell her\\noutright. One day she came to me with one of her many dreams: She\\nhad journeyed alone deep into the depths of an old-growth forest and\\nmet a dwarf dressed like a harlequin in the darkness and gloom. The\\ndwarf offered to answer a question, if my client had one to ask. She\\n\\n\\x0casked the strange figure what she would have to do to finish her\\ncollege certificate, a task that had taken her the four aforementioned\\nyears and plenty of negotiation with the requisite university\\nauthorities for permission to continue. The answer she received?\\n“You will have to learn to work in a slaughterhouse.”\\n\\nNow, as far as I am concerned, dreams are statements from\\n\\nnature. It is not so much that we create them. They manifest\\nthemselves to us. I have never seen a dream present something I\\nbelieved to be untrue. I also do not believe—contra Freud—that\\ndreams attempt to disguise what they mean. They are, instead, an\\nearlier part of the process by which fully developed thoughts come to\\nbe born, as they certainly do not just appear magically out of\\nnowhere. We must confront the unknown, as such—the great Dragon\\nof Chaos or the Terrible Queen—and we do not know how to do it, to\\nbegin with. The dream serves as the first cognitive step—in the wake\\nof basic emotional, motivational, and bodily reactions such as fear or\\ncuriosity or freezing—in transforming that unknown into actionable\\nand even articulable knowledge. The dream is the birthplace of the\\nthought, and often of the thought that does not come easily to the\\nconscious mind. It is not hiding anything; it is just not very good at\\nbeing clear (although that certainly does not mean that it cannot be\\nprofound).\\n\\nIn any case, this dream was not difficult to interpret, particularly\\nbecause its main character, the dwarf, simply spoke his mind. So, I\\nlistened carefully to my client’s account (remember, this was after\\nthe butcher shop and the farm) and asked her what we might do\\nabout that. I had no idea how I might arrange a visit to an actual\\nslaughterhouse. I did not even know if they existed in the city we\\ninhabited, and if they did, I could not imagine they would appreciate\\nvisitors, regardless of motivation. She was convinced, however, that\\nshe had been told the truth, and that something of the sort had to be\\ndone. So we discussed the consequences of her toughening up, and\\nthe fact that she had successfully put her hypercritical stepmother on\\nthe back burner, and left it at that for the remainder of the session,\\nalthough she was tasked (as was I) with determining something that\\nmight serve as a reasonable substitute for a slaughterhouse.\\nA week later, she returned for her scheduled session. She\\nannounced the last thing, perhaps, that I could have possibly\\nimagined from her—or anyone else, for that matter: “I think I need to\\n\\n\\x0csee an embalming.” I did not know what to say. I did not want to see\\nan embalming, personally—not at all. I had seen body sections in\\nscience museums, and there was something about them that refused\\nto leave my memory. I had also gone to see one of the displays of\\nplasticized, sculptured bodies that were so popular about a decade\\nago, and I was horrified by it. I became a psychologist, not a surgeon\\n—or, for that matter, a coroner—for a reason. However, this was not\\nabout me. It was about my client, Sleeping Beauty, and her desire to\\nawaken, and there was no way I was going to let my wishes or lack\\nthereof interfere with whatever wisdom the dwarf who inhabited the\\ndeep forest of her unconscious mind was about to impart. I told her I\\nwould see what I could do. It all turned out to be much simpler to\\narrange than I expected. I simply picked up the phone and called a\\nlocal mortician’s office. To my great surprise, he immediately agreed.\\nI suppose he had seen his fair share of people grieving and\\nfrightened, and was accustomed to dealing with them calmly and\\nwisely. So that was that. I was stuck with the visit, and my client\\nwanted to go through with it.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, we went to the funeral home. My client had\\n\\nasked me if a friend could attend with her, and I said yes. The\\nmortician offered the three of us a tour first. He showed us the\\nchapel and the display room for the caskets. We asked him how he\\nmanaged his job, given its endless concentration on death and\\nsuffering and grief. He said that it was his heartfelt responsibility to\\nmake his clients’ most terrible of times the least painful they could\\nbe, and that he took heart from that. That made sense to both of us,\\nand helped us understand how he could continue with his work, day\\nin and out. After the tour, we went to the embalming room. It was a\\nsmall space, perhaps a hundred feet square. The naked body of an\\naged man was lying motionless, gray, and mottled on a stainless-\\nsteel table. Because there was not space in the small room, and to\\nprovide us both with some distance, my client, her friend, and I took\\nour places in the hallway immediately outside the door and observed\\nthe proceedings, which were entirely unimpeded by our trivial\\nseparation from the mortician’s operations. He drained the blood\\nand other liquids from the body. They ran undramatically but in\\nsome sense all the more horribly for that, because of their mundane\\nmode of disposal, I suppose. It seemed like something that precious\\nand vital deserved better. He made his surgical alterations, and\\n\\n\\x0csewed together the eyelids, and made up the face, and injected the\\nembalming fluid. I watched. And I watched my client. To begin with,\\nshe looked down the hallway, avoiding the scene unfolding in front of\\nher. But as the minutes ticked by, she started to glance at the\\nproceedings, and by the time a quarter of an hour had passed, she\\nwas spending far more time observing than looking away. I could\\nsee, however, that she had taken her friend’s hand, and was gripping\\nit tightly.\\n\\nShe was seeing firsthand that something she had believed would\\n\\nterrify her (and reasonably so) was not in fact doing so. She could\\nmanage the experience. She did not panic, become ill, run away, or\\neven cry. She asked the mortician if she could put a hand on the\\nbody. He offered her a rubber glove, which she pulled on. She walked\\ndirectly into the operating station, in a quiet and meditative state,\\nand placed her gloved hand on the ribs of the body, and she kept it\\nthere, as if it was a comfort both to her and the poor departed soul.\\nThe procedure terminated soon after that, and we left quietly\\ntogether, after offering the mortician our genuine and heartfelt\\nthanks.\\n\\nThe three of us expressed our shared astonishment that we had\\n\\nmanaged such a visit. My client had learned something vitally\\nimportant about her tolerance for the terrors of life. Equally\\nimportantly, she had a reference point for her fears: from that point\\nonward (and I am by no means claiming complete success in her\\ntreatment) she had something truly awe inspiring—something truly\\nserious and horrifying and graphic and real—to compare with the\\nother, almost inevitably lesser, horrors of life. Were the mundane\\nmiseries of existence as challenging as the experience she had put\\nherself through voluntarily? Was the butcher shop more frightening\\nthan human death, in all its reality, at such close proximity? Had she\\nnot demonstrated to herself that she could encounter the worst that\\nTerrible Nature could throw at her and face it courageously? And\\nthat was to her a paradoxical and ineradicable source of comfort.\\n\\nAs with the Sleeping Beauty of fairy tales, my client’s family had\\nfailed to invite the Evil Queen, the terrible aspect of nature, into their\\nchild’s life. This left her completely unprepared for life’s essential\\nharshness—the complications of sexuality and the requirement for\\neverything that lives to devour other lives (and to be eventually\\nsubjected to the same fate). The Evil Queen made her reappearance\\n\\n\\x0cat puberty—in the form of my client’s stepmother, whose character\\napparently turned 180 degrees—as well as in her own personal\\ninability to deal with the responsibilities of maturity and stark\\nobligations of biological survival. Like Sleeping Beauty, as well—as\\nthat tale is multistoried and deep in the way of ancient fairy tales,\\nwhich can be thousands of years old—she needed to be awakened by\\nthe forces of exploration, courage, and fortitude (often represented\\nby the redeeming prince, but which she found within herself).\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIf the Dragon of Chaos and the paired Benevolent and Evil Queen are\\nrepresentatives of potential and of the unknown, the Wise King and\\nthe Authoritarian Tyrant are representatives of the structures, social\\nand psychological, that enable us to overlay structure on that\\npotential. We interpret the present through the lens of culture. We\\nplan for the future by attempting to bring into being what we have\\nbeen taught and what we have determined, personally, to value. All\\nof that seems good, but a too-rigid approach to understanding what\\nis currently in front of us and what we should pursue can blind us to\\nthe value of novelty, creativity, and change. When the structures that\\nguide us are merely secure, rather than inflexible, we leaven our\\ndesire for routine and predictability with the curiosity that makes us\\nattracted to and appreciative of what remains outside our conceptual\\nschemes. When those same structures degenerate into stasis, we run\\nfrom and deny the existence of what we do not yet understand and\\nwhat we have not yet encountered, and this means that we make\\nourselves unable to change when change is required. Understanding\\nthat both possibilities exist is of crucial importance to establish the\\nbalance that is required in life.\\n\\nWe could use a poetic metaphor to represent the elements of\\n\\nexperience that we have so far discussed (this is in fact how the world\\nI am describing is usually considered). Imagine the realm of the\\nDragon of Chaos as the night sky, stretching infinitely above you on a\\nclear night, representing what will remain forever outside your\\ndomain of understanding. Maybe you are standing on a beach,\\nlooking up, lost in contemplation and imagination. Then you turn\\nyour attention to the ocean—as grand in its way as the starry cosmos,\\n\\n\\x0cbut tangible and manifest and knowable, comparatively speaking.\\nThat is nature. It is not mere potential. It is there, in its\\nunknowability, instead of removed from comprehension entirely. It\\nis not yet tamed, however; not brought into the domain of order. And\\nit is beautiful in its mystery. The moon reflects on its surface; the\\nwaves crash eternally and lull you to sleep; you can swim in its\\nwelcoming waters. But that beauty has a price. You better keep an\\neye out for sharks. And poisonous jellyfish. And the riptide that can\\npull you or your children under. And the storms that could destroy\\nyour warm and welcoming beach house.\\n\\nImagine, further, that the beach on which you stand is the shore of\\n\\nan island. The island is culture. People live there—perhaps in\\nharmony and peace, under a benevolent ruler; perhaps in a war-torn\\nhell of oppression, hunger, and privation. And that is culture: Wise\\nKing or Authoritarian Tyrant. It is of vital necessity to become\\nacquainted with both characters, just as in the case of Evil Queen and\\nBenevolent Goddess, to ensure the appropriate balance in attitude\\nrequired to adapt properly to the vicissitudes of life. Too much\\nemphasis on the Wise King blinds those who hold that attitude to the\\ninjustice and unnecessary suffering that is a consequence of the\\ninevitable flaws in our all-too-human social structures. Too much\\ninsistence on the Authoritarian Tyrant means lack of appreciation for\\nthe often fragile structures that bind us together and protect us from\\nthe chaos that would otherwise certainly reign.\\n\\nThe ideological systems we are prone to adopting—the systems\\n\\nthat so polarize us, politically and personally, can be profitably\\nunderstood in light of the present conceptualization. They are\\ncultural narratives usefully considered as parasites upon a more\\nfundamental religious, mythological, or dramatic substructure—\\nancient, evolved, and deeply biological in its nature. Ideologies take\\non the structure of a story that is essentially religious, but they do so\\nincompletely, including certain elements of experience or eternal\\ncharacters while ignoring others. The power remains in the\\nrepresentation, nonetheless, because what is included retains its\\nfundamentally mythological/biological nature—its instinctual\\nmeaning—but the missing elements mean that what remains,\\nhowever powerful in its expression, is biased in a way that restricts\\nits utility. That bias is desirable subjectively, as it simplifies what\\nwould otherwise be too complex to understand, but dangerous\\n\\n\\x0cbecause of its one-sidedness. If the map you are using is missing part\\nof the world, you are going to be utterly unprepared when that\\nabsent element makes itself manifest. How is it possible for us to\\nretain the advantages of simplification, without falling prey to the\\naccompanying blindness? The answer is to be found in the constant\\ndialogue between genuinely different types of people.\\n\\nMuch of what people believe politically—ideologically, let us say—\\n\\nis based on their inborn temperament. If their emotions or\\nmotivations tend to tilt one way (and much of that is a consequence\\nof biology), then they tend to adopt, say, a conservative or liberal\\ntendency. It is not a matter of opinion. Imagine, instead, that\\nanimals have a niche—a place or space that suits them. Their biology\\nis matched to that place. Lions are not found in the open ocean, and\\nkiller whales do not roam the African veldt. The animal and its\\nenvironment are of a piece.\\n\\nHuman beings are similar, at least in the realm of abstraction. We\\n\\nare nonetheless capable of making ourselves at home almost\\neverywhere, geographically, because we change the geography, as\\nnecessary, as well as modify our own behavior. But we have\\nperceptual or cognitive niches. Liberals, for example, are positively\\nenthralled by new ideas. The advantages to being attracted by new\\nideas are obvious. Sometimes problems require new solutions, and it\\nis people who take pleasure in novel conceptions who find them.\\nSuch people also tend not to be particularly orderly.6 Perhaps this is\\nbecause if you are gripped and driven by new ideas, and are also\\ninclined to test or implement them, you need to be able to tolerate\\nthe intermediary chaos produced between the time the old idea\\ndisintegrates and the new idea takes control. If you are a\\nconservative, you have the opposite advantage and problem. You are\\nwary of new ideas, and not particularly attracted to them, and that is\\nin part because you are less sensitive to their possibilities and more\\nconcerned about their unpredicted consequences. Just because a new\\nidea fixes one problem, after all, does not mean that it will fail to\\ngenerate another, or several others. If you are conservative, you like\\nthings to be where they are supposed to be, when they are supposed\\nto be there. You are in the place you want to be when people act\\nconventionally, responsibly, and predictably.\\n\\nConservatives are necessary for maintaining things the way they\\n\\nare when everything is working and change might be dangerous.\\n\\n\\x0cLiberals, by contrast, are necessary for changing things when they\\nare no longer working. It is no easy task, however, to determine when\\nsomething needs to be preserved or when it needs to be transformed.\\nThat is why we have politics, if we are fortunate, and the dialogue\\nthat accompanies it, instead of war, tyranny, or submission. It is\\nnecessary for us to argue vociferously and passionately about the\\nrelative value of stability versus change, so that we can determine\\nwhen each is appropriate and in what doses.\\n\\nIt is of great interest to note that difference in fundamental\\npolitical belief appears to determine which of the twinned Great\\nFathers are considered of fundamental reality. The liberal tends\\nstrongly to see the world as the Authoritarian Tyrant suppressing the\\nBenevolent Goddess—as the arbitrary strictures of dead culture\\ncorrupting and oppressing citizen and foreigner alike, or as the\\nmilitary-industrial structure of modern society threatening Gaia, the\\nliving planet, with pollution, mass extinction, or climate change.\\nSuch a viewpoint is obviously useful when culture has become truly\\ntyrannical—and that is by no means uncommon. The conservative\\ntends, conversely, to see the world as Wise King—security of place,\\norder, and predictability—bringing to heel, taming and disciplining\\nthe Evil Queen—nature as disorder and chaos. That is obviously\\nnecessary as well. No matter how beautiful the natural world, we\\nshould remember that it is always conspiring to starve, sicken, and\\nkill us, and that if we lacked the protective shield constituted by\\nCulture as Security we would be devoured by wild animals, frozen by\\nblizzards, prostrated by the heat of the desert, and starved by the fact\\nthat food does not simply manifest itself for our delectation. So there\\nare two different ideologies—both of which are “correct,” but each of\\nwhich tell only half the story.*\\n\\nTo develop a properly balanced view of the world of experience, it\\n\\nis necessary to accept the reality of both elements of culture. Those\\nwith a conservative bent, drawn temperamentally to regard the\\nstatus quo as protective, must to come to understand that mere order\\nis insufficient. Because the future and the present differ from the\\npast, what worked before will not necessarily work now, and it is\\nnecessary to understand that the line between the stability\\nbequeathed to us by our ancestors and the tyranny that can so easily\\nbecome shifts and moves with the transformations of existence.\\nEqually, however, the more liberal types, prone to see the\\n\\n\\x0cAuthoritarian Tyrant everywhere, must work to develop gratitude for\\nthe social and psychological structures of interpretation that\\ncontinually shield us from the terrors of nature and the absolute\\nunknown. It is difficult for any of us to see what we are blinded to by\\nthe nature of our personalities. It is for this reason that we must\\ncontinually listen to people who differ from us, and who, because of\\nthat difference, have the ability to see and to react appropriately to\\nwhat we cannot detect.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nIf the night sky is chaos, the ocean nature, and the island culture,\\nthen the individual—hero and adversary—is one brother locked in\\ncombat with his twin in the middle of the isle. Chaos, treasure and\\ndragon, have their negative and positive element, as do Nature—Evil\\nQueen and Benevolent Mother—and Culture—Authoritarian Tyrant\\nand Wise King. No less the individual. The positive element is the\\nheroic aspect: the person who can sacrifice properly to nature and\\nstrike a bargain with fate such that benevolence reigns; the person\\nwho is awake, alert, attentive, communicative, and bears\\nresponsibility, so that the tyrannical part of the state remains at bay;\\nand the person who is aware of his or her own faults and proclivity\\nfor malevolence and deceit, so that proper orientation is maintained.\\nThe negative element is everything despicable and contemptible—\\nparticularly evident in yourself, if you have any sense, but also\\nmanifested to some degree by other people and (more clearly) in\\nstories. Those are the hostile brothers, a very old mythological idea:\\nthe hero and the adversary. The archetypal representations of those\\ntwo forces, those two personified figures, are Cain and Abel. That is\\none level of representation. Christ and Satan are a pair representing\\nan even more fundamental duality. Cain and Abel, after all, are\\nhuman (the first humans, born in the human manner, as Adam and\\nEve were created directly by God). Christ and Satan are elements of\\npersonified (deified?) eternity itself.\\n\\nSo, there exists a hero and an adversary; a wise king and a tyrant;\\na positive and negative maternal figure; and chaos itself. That is the\\nstructure of the world in six characters (with the strange seventh of\\nchaos in some sense the ultimate birthplace of all the others). It is\\n\\n\\x0cnecessary to understand that all seven exist, and that they are all\\nexistential permanents—elements of experience with which every\\nsoul, rich, poor, blessed, cursed, talented, dull, male, and female\\nmust inevitably contend. That is life—they are life. Partial knowledge\\nof the cast, conscious or unconscious, leaves you undefended; leaves\\nyou naive, unprepared, and likely to become possessed by deceit,\\nresentment, and arrogance. If you do not know that the treasure is\\nguarded by a dragon, or that nature, beautiful nature, can turn its\\nteeth on you in an instant, or that the peaceful society you take for\\ngranted is threatened constantly by authoritarianism and tyranny, or\\nthat you contain within yourself the adversary who might wish that\\nall those negative transformations occur, then you are, first, a needy\\nacolyte for an ideology that will provide you with a partial and\\ninsufficient representation of reality; and, second, someone blind in\\na manner dangerous to themselves and others alike. If you are wise,\\nyour political philosophy encompasses a representation of all seven,\\neven if you could not articulate it in those terms. We should always\\nhave enough sense to keep in mind, for example, that a great\\npredator lurks beneath the thin ice of our constructed realities. I\\nremember a vision I once had about my then very young daughter,\\nportraying exactly that reality. In the winter, in Northern Alberta—\\nwhere, as I said, I grew up—there were years where the snow stayed\\nat bay for weeks after the lakes themselves had frozen, smooth,\\nperfectly clear, rock hard, barren, and not without beauty and\\nmystery. (A stone skipped across their expanse would chime and\\necho melodically as it skidded across the slippery surface.) I\\nimagined my daughter Mikhaila—a toddler dressed only in a diaper—\\nsitting at some distance from me, directly on the ice. Underneath\\nher, I could see a huge fish, a whale shark (although carnivorous, in\\nthis incarnation)—hanging motionless below her, waiting, upright in\\nthe water underneath the ice, mouth gaping. That is life, and death,\\nand the pure chaos that destroys our hard-won certainties, but it is\\nalso the prophet-swallowing whale who grants wisdom and rebirth, if\\nit does not kill.\\n\\nAnd what is the proper attitude of the hero, let us say, with respect\\n\\nto the remaining six characters (assuming we have dealt sufficiently\\nwith chaos with that last anecdote)? Obviously, we must endeavor to\\npreserve Nature, upon whose benevolence we are finally dependent\\nfor everything that life requires. But it is also perfectly worthwhile for\\n\\n\\x0cus to note and take seriously the fact that the same Nature is doing\\nher best to kill us, and that we have every reason to erect the\\nstructures we do, despite their often unfortunate environmental\\ncosts.* Something similar applies to culture. We all have reason to be\\ngrateful, in the main, for the wisdom and the structure that our\\nforebears bequeathed to us, to their great cost. That does not mean\\nthat those benefits are distributed equally, because they are not and\\nnever will be, no more than the benefits of Nature are distributed\\nequally. That gratitude also does not justify any willfully blind\\noptimism with regard to the nature of society. As individuals—\\nstruggling, let us say, against the adversarial tendency and the\\nAuthoritarian Tyrant simultaneously—we need to be awake to the\\nfact that our functional hierarchical structures can become\\nunproductive, tyrannical, and blind in the blink of an eye. We have a\\nresponsibility to ensure that they do not become radically unfair and\\ncorrupt and begin to distribute their rewards on the basis of power or\\nunmeritocratic privilege instead of competence. We must attend to\\nthem constantly and adjust them carefully so they remain sufficiently\\nstable and appropriately dynamic. That is a fundamental part of our\\nroles and responsibilities as persons aiming courageously at the\\ngood. We manage that partly in democratic systems by throwing out\\nthe people in charge on a regular basis, and replacing them with their\\nideological opposites. That capability and opportunity constitutes\\none of the fundamental achievements of a democratic society. In the\\nabsence of the ability to regularly choose only the wise and good as\\nleaders (and good luck finding them), it is worthwhile to elect a pack\\nblind to half of reality in one cycle and another blind to the other half\\nthe next. Then at least most of society’s concerns are attended to in\\nsome reasonable measure over the course of something\\napproximating a decade.\\n\\nI think that somewhat pessimistic but also eminently realistic\\nstrategy is in keeping with the vision of the people who founded the\\nAmerican system (and the actions and attitudes of the English and\\nother early democrats and parliamentarians whose gradually\\nevolving systems laid the groundwork for the explicit claims those\\nfounders made). They were not utopian in their essential viewpoint.\\nThey believed that the people who were inevitably to be their\\nsuccessors were going to be just as flawed as they were, and just as\\nflawed as people before them. What do you do about that, when you\\n\\n\\x0care not blinded by ideology, and you see the world and all its\\ndramatic characters clearly? Well, you do not hope for the infinite\\nperfectibility of humanity and aim your system at some unattainable\\nutopia. You try to design a system that sinners such as you cannot\\ndamage too badly—too permanently—even when they are half blind\\nand resentful. To the degree that I am conservative in orientation, I\\nbelieve in the wisdom of that vision. I believe that is a more\\nappropriate way of looking at things. Let us not get too grandiose.\\nWe can design systems that allow us a modicum of peace, security,\\nand freedom and, perhaps, the possibility of incremental\\nimprovement. That is a miracle in and of itself. We should have the\\nwisdom to doubt that we will produce some positive transformation\\nof individual, society, and nature simultaneously, particularly if\\nthose improvements are to be brought about in consequence of our\\nown intrinsic, personal goodwill, which is often in too short supply\\n(despite our protestations to the contrary).\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nWhy do you and others fall prey to resentment—that terrible hybrid\\nemotional state, an admixture of anger and self-pity, tinged, to\\nvarious degrees, with narcissism and the desire for revenge? Once\\nyou understand the world as a dramatic forum, and you have\\nidentified the major players, the reasons become clear. You are\\nresentful because of the absolute unknown and its terrors, because\\nnature conspires against you, because you are a victim of the\\ntyrannical element of culture, and because of the malevolence of\\nyourself and other individuals. That is reason enough. It does not\\nmake your resentment appropriate, but it certainly makes the\\nemotion understandable. None of these existential problems are\\ntrivial. In fact, they are serious enough to make the real question not\\n“Why are you resentful?” but “Why is not everyone resentful about\\neverything all the time?” We are the focus of unbelievably powerful\\nand often malevolent transpersonal forces. There is a terrible\\nreptilian predator, metaphorically speaking, pursuing you all the\\ntime, just like the crocodile with the ticktock of time emanating from\\nthe clock he swallowed chasing the tyrannical coward Captain Hook.\\nAnd there is nature herself. She is hell-bent on doing you in, in a\\n\\n\\x0cmillion horrible ways. Then there is the tyrannical element of the\\nsocial structure, which has molded you—taught you, so to speak—\\nand made you into the quasi-civilized, semi-useful creature that you\\nare, but crushed a tremendous amount of life force out of you at the\\nsame time, pounding you like the proverbial square peg into the\\nround hole. There were many things you could have been. Maybe\\nsome of them were more than you have become. But you were\\nlessened and reduced by the demand for social existence.\\n\\nAnd you are stuck with yourself, too, and that is no picnic. You\\n\\nprocrastinate, you are lazy, you lie, and you do vicious things to\\nyourself and others. It is no wonder you feel like a victim, given what\\nis arrayed against you: chaos, the brute force of nature, the tyranny\\nof culture, and the malevolence of your own nature. It is no wonder\\nyou might feel resentful. And it is certainly the case that these forces\\nare arrayed against some of you in a manner that seems far more\\nserious, unjust, arbitrary, continuous, and unpredictable than it\\nseems for others. How could you fail to feel victimized and resentful\\nunder those conditions? Life contains no shortage of fundamental\\nbrutality.\\n\\nThere is a problem with this logic, however, inexorable though it\\nmay seem. The first is that not everyone does in fact construe him or\\nherself as a victim and fall prey, in consequence, to resentment—and\\nthat includes a large proportion of people who have had a very hard\\ntime in their lives. In fact, I think it is reasonable to posit that it is\\noften the people who have had too easy a time—who have been\\npampered and elevated falsely in their self-esteem—who adopt the\\nrole of victim and the mien of resentment. You can encounter people,\\ncontrarily, who have been hurt virtually beyond all hope of repair\\nwho are not resentful and who would never deign to present\\nthemselves as victims. They are not that common, but they are not so\\nvery rare either. Thus, resentment does not appear to be an\\ninevitable consequence of suffering itself. Other factors are at play, in\\naddition to the undeniable tragedy of life.\\n\\nMaybe you—or just as tragically, someone close to you—contracts\\n\\na serious illness. It is typical in such circumstances to ask the\\nquestion (of whom? God?) “Why did this have to happen to me?”\\nWell, what do you mean? Would you wish it instead upon a friend,\\nneighbor, or even a random stranger? You certainly might be\\ntempted to spread your misery, but such a response does not seem\\n\\n\\x0ceither reasonable or a choice that a good person, thinking clearly,\\nwould ever make, and it certainly would not make the situation more\\njust. To be fair, the question “Why me?” constitutes, in part, a\\npsychologically appropriate response. It is often the case that if\\nsomething bad happens to you, you should ask yourself if there is\\nsomething that you have done in the past that has increased the\\nprobability of the terrible event—as we have discussed at length—\\nbecause it is possible that you have something to learn that would\\ndecrease the chances of its recurrence. But often that is not at all\\nwhat we are doing. The question “Why did this have to happen to\\nme?” frequently contains a reproachful element, based on a sense of\\ninjustice: “There are all these bad people in the world, and they seem\\nto be getting away unpunished for this misbehavior,” or “There are\\nall these people in the world who are enjoying good health, and it\\nseems singularly unfair for them to be in that fortunate position\\nwhen I am not.” That means that “Why me?” is in this manner\\ngenerally contaminated with a sense of victimization, signifying\\ninjustice. This false misapprehension that the terrible experience\\nthat has befallen you somehow singularly characterizes you—is\\naimed, particularly, at you—is part of what turns exposure to tragedy\\ninto the very resentment we are discussing.\\n\\nThe fact that unfortunate things are happening or are going to\\nhappen to you is built into the structure of reality itself. There is no\\ndoubt that awful things happen, but there is an element of true\\nrandomness about them. You might think, “That is trivial\\ncompensation, and of little help.” But some appreciation for the\\nrandom element can be helpful, by distancing the personal element,\\nand that can help you erect some barriers to developing that intense\\negotistical resentment. Furthermore, it can be of great utility to\\nrealize that each of the negatives that characterize human existence\\nare balanced, in principle, by their positive counterpart.\\n\\nHere is something I have learned in my years as a clinical\\n\\npsychologist. I constantly saw people who were hurt by life. They had\\ntheir reasons for feeling resentful, and those reasons were often far\\nfrom trivial. I would propose: “Let us take your problems apart, even\\nthough many of them are real. We will try to figure out which ones\\nare your fault, because some of them are going to be. Some of them,\\nalternatively, are just the catastrophe of life. We will delineate that\\nvery carefully. Then we will start having you practice overcoming\\n\\n\\x0cwhatever it is that you are bringing to the situation that is making it\\nworse. We will start to make some strategic plans about how you\\nmight confront the parts of your life that are truly just tragic, and we\\nwill get you to do that in a truthful, open, and courageous manner.\\nThen we will watch what happens.”\\n\\nPeople got better. Not always. Some of my clients even died. We\\n\\nwould be halfway through their clinical issues, and they would be\\ncarried off by a sudden cancer or killed in a traffic accident. There is\\nno certain path, even with the noblest of actions. The arbitrariness of\\nthe world is always at the ready, preparing to manifest itself. There is\\nno reason or excuse to be stupidly naive or optimistic. But most\\npeople did get better. Encouragement prepared them to confront\\ntheir problems head-on, and that voluntary confrontation dispelled\\nsome of their fear. This was not because things around them became\\nless dangerous, but because the people facing the danger became\\nbraver. It is unbelievable how strong and courageous people can\\nbecome. It is miraculous what sort of load people can bear when they\\ntake it on voluntarily. I know we cannot have an infinite capacity for\\nthat, but I also believe that it is in some sense unlimited. I think the\\nmore voluntary confrontation is practiced, the more can be borne. I\\ndo not know what the upper limit is for that.*\\n\\nPeople not only become encouraged, so they can stave off the\\nhorror and resentment from a psychological perspective, but they\\nalso become more able. Not only are they contending with the\\nexistential burden of life more effectively from a spiritual\\nperspective, say, but they start to be better people in the world. They\\nstart to constrain the malevolence and resentment in their own\\nhearts that makes the horror of the world even more dismal than it\\nmust be. They become more honest. They make better friends. They\\nmake more productive and meaningful career choices. They start\\naiming higher. Thus, they can cope better, psychologically, but they\\nalso reduce the volume of what they and the others around them\\nmust cope with. Then they suffer less unnecessarily, and so do their\\nfamilies. Then, maybe, the same thing starts to happen with their\\ncommunities. And then there is the other half of the story: the\\ntreasure that the dragon hoards, the benevolent element of nature,\\nthe security and shelter provided by society and culture, and the\\nstrength of the individual. Those are your weapons in times of\\ntrouble. And they are just as real, and perhaps of sufficient power,\\n\\n\\x0cthat their full use will provide you with the means to cope when your\\nlife falls apart. The issue is: can you organize the structure of reality\\nso that you find the treasure, the positive aspect of nature smiles\\nupon you, you are ruled by the wise king, and you play the role of\\nhero? The hope is that you can conduct yourself in such a manner\\nthat it tilts things in that direction. That it is all we have—and it is\\nmuch better than nothing. If you confront the suffering and\\nmalevolence, and if you do that truthfully and courageously, you are\\nstronger, your family is stronger, and the world is a better place. The\\nalternative is resentment, and that makes everything worse.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThere appear to be two broad forms of deceit: sins of commission,\\nthe things you do knowing full well they are wrong; and sins of\\nomission, which are things you merely let slide—you know you\\nshould look at, do, or say something, but you do not. Maybe your\\nbusiness partner is a little bit crooked with the books, and you decide\\nthat you are just not going to audit them; or you turn a blind eye to\\nyour own misbehavior; or you fail to investigate the misdeeds of a\\nchild, adolescent, or your partner in your household. Instead, you\\njust let it go.\\n\\nWhat motivates these kinds of deceit? We lie, outright—the sin of\\ncommission—knowing full well that we are doing so, to make things\\neasier for us, in theory, regardless of the effect upon other people.\\nWe try to tip the world in our own personal favor. We try to gain an\\nedge. We endeavor to avoid a just punishment that is coming our\\nway—often by passing it to others. We commit the sin of omission,\\nalternatively (and perhaps more subtly), in the belief that what we\\nare avoiding will just go away, which it seldom does. We sacrifice the\\nfuture to the present, frequently suffering the slings and arrows of\\noutraged conscience for doing so, but continuing, rigidly and\\nstubbornly, in any case.\\n\\nSo, what do people use to justify bending and twisting the\\n\\nstructure of reality, at the cost of others or even their future selves, to\\nbenefit themselves now? It is a motivation clearly embedded in\\nresentment. Lies are justified by the belief lurking at the bottom of\\nthe resentful soul that the terrors of the world have been aimed\\n\\n\\x0cspecifically at the sufferer attempting to justify his lying. But we need\\nto bring arrogance into the conversation, along with resentment, to\\ntruly understand why we practice to deceive. It is not obvious that\\nthese states of mind can exist in the absence of each other, anyway.\\nThey are coconspirators, so to speak.\\n\\nC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\nThe first conspiracy between deceit and arrogance might be regarded\\nas a denial or rejection of the relationship between divinity, truth,\\nand goodness. In the early chapters of Genesis, God creates habitable\\nchaos out of order with the Word, with the Logos: courage, love, and\\ntruth. Courage, we might say, is the willingness of God to confront\\nthe nothingness that preceded Being, which is perhaps of the same\\nform we manage when we rise up from poverty and nothingness to\\nthrive, or rebuild our lives when they have been reduced to chaos by\\ndisaster and catastrophe. Love is the ultimate aim—the desire to\\ncreate the very best that can be created. It provides the same kind of\\nsuperstructure for Being, perhaps, as the desire for a peaceful and\\nharmonious home provides when such desire allows the truth to be\\nspoken. The Word God uses to confront the nothingness we spoke of\\nis the Truth, and that truth creates. But it does not just create: it\\nappears to create the Good—the very best that love would demand. It\\nis not for nothing that God is so insistent that what has been created\\nis Good. Arrogance and deceit unite to oppose the idea that\\ncourageous truth aimed at love creates the Good, and replace it with\\nthe idea that any whim, large or small, has the right and opportunity\\nto reveal itself for purposes that are instead narrow and self-serving.\\nThe second form of arrogance that enables deceit has something to\\n\\ndo with the assumption of the power of divinity itself. Someone who\\nlies, through action, inaction, words, or silence, has made a choice\\nabout what element of becoming (what element of still-unformed but\\npotential chaos) is or is not going to manifest itself. This means that\\nthe deceitful individual has taken it upon him or herself to alter the\\nvery structure of reality. And for what? For a wish based on the idea\\nthat whatever egotistical falsehood conjured up by the act of deceit\\nwill be better than the reality that would have transpired had the\\ntruth been enacted or spoken. The liar acts out the belief that the\\n\\n\\x0cfalse world he brings into being, however temporarily, will serve at\\nleast his own interests better than the alternative. That is the\\narrogance of someone who believes that he can alter the structure of\\nreality through pretense, and that he can get away with it. It is not\\nclear how either of these beliefs could be sustained, if they are\\nthought through carefully (which implies, of course, that they are\\ngenerally not). First, the transgressor himself is going to know that\\nhe is not to be trusted in word or action, and then, to the degree that\\ngenuine self-regard relies on such truth, the deceitful words and acts\\nare inevitably going to undermine the personality of the liar. At\\nminimum, he will not be living in the real world, or in the same\\nworld as other people, and so he will be weaker than he would have\\nbeen had he learned what was true instead of having substituted for\\nit what is false. Second, for the liar to genuinely believe that he is\\n“going to get away with it,” carries with it the belief that he is smarter\\nthan everyone else—that is, the everyone who will not notice (and\\nperhaps that belief comes to encompass God, the Creator, whether\\nexplicitly or implicitly). Perhaps he will get away with one, two, or\\nten lies, of increasing severity, as he is emboldened by success. Each\\ntime he succeeds, however, his arrogance will increase, as success is\\nrewarding and will inspire efforts to duplicate and even increase that\\nreward. This cannot help but motivate larger and riskier lies, each\\nassociated with a longer fall from the heights of pride. The strategy\\nseems unworkable—a positive feedback loop designed to drag those\\nwho entrap themselves within it lower and lower, faster and faster.\\nThe third form of arrogance that underlies deceit has to do with\\nthe belief that the deceitful act (which, as we already discussed, has\\nbent or warped the structure of reality) will stand on its own\\npowerfully, without being revealed and destroyed as reality itself\\nstraightens and reforms, as it inevitably will. That is the arrogance\\nbehind the liar’s belief that the lie has somehow permanently altered\\nthe form of the world, so that now life in the world can be conducted\\nas if that lie is somehow real. But reality is very complicated and\\nalmost everything, it seems, touches on everything else. It is very\\ndifficult, for example, to make the consequences of an adulterous\\naffair stop spreading. People are seen. Tongues start to wag. More\\nlies are generated and must be validated to account for the time\\nspent on the affair. Scents linger. Affection within the relationship\\nstarts to be replaced by hatred or contempt (particularly if the\\n\\n\\x0cbetrayed person is a genuinely good person, providing no excuse for\\nthe sinful actions taken against him or her).\\n\\nThe fourth form of arrogance that justifies deceit has to do with a\\nwarped sense of justice, often brought about by resentment. People\\nemploy deception in this fourth set of circumstances because they\\nare resentful and angry about their victimized positions in the hell\\nand tragedy of the world. This response is entirely understandable,\\nalthough no less dangerous because of that. The logic is simple and\\neven compelling, particularly in the case of people who have been\\ntruly hurt: “I can do what I want because I have been unfairly\\ntreated.” This reasoning can be seen as simple justice, although it is\\nseldom the case that the people who are now being lied to or\\ndeceived are the same individuals who produced the unfair\\ntreatment used to justify the falsehood. The arrogance is in believing\\nthat the unfair treatment was specifically personal, existentially\\nspeaking, rather than being an expected part of existence itself, given\\nits unknown natural, social, and individual dangers. If you have been\\nthe victim of what appears to be some malevolent cosmic joke, then\\nwhy should not you do whatever is in your power to set things a little\\nbit right for yourself? All that line of reasoning does, however, is\\nmake life worse. If your justification for misbehaving was that life\\nwas bad, then the rationale for continuing to misbehave cannot\\nreasonably be that you should embark on a pattern of action that\\ndoes nothing but make it more so.\\n\\nO\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\nThere are a variety of reasons why you stand idly by when something\\nyou know to be terrible and wrong is occurring, and do nothing\\n(including what you know you should have done) to interfere. The\\nfirst of these is nihilism. It might not be immediately obvious what\\nnihilism and pride have to do with each other (and even less what\\nboth have to do with sins of omission). But the nihilistic attitude is\\none of certainty: everything is meaningless, or even negative. It is a\\njudgment, a conclusion—and it is a sin of pride, in my estimation. I\\nthink we are properly bounded in humility by a reasonable sense of\\nour own ignorance not to take the terrible risk of damning the\\nstructure of existence itself.\\n\\n\\x0cAnother motive for a sin of omission? The claim that it is\\n\\njustifiable to take the easy path. This means living life so that true\\nresponsibility for anything important never falls on your shoulders.\\nAnd you might think that is perfectly acceptable: “Why should I\\nexpend extra effort and risk when someone else is lining up for it;\\npushing actively for it; or just not sophisticated enough to slip away\\nfrom it when it seeks them out?” But everyone should take their turn\\n—both at receiving the benefits of social interaction and of bearing\\nthe responsibility for ensuring that such interaction remains\\npossible. Children who do not learn that at three do not make any\\nfriends, and there are good reasons for that. They do not know how\\nto play a game that can sustain itself across time, which is exactly\\nwhat a friendship is (as well as the attitude that makes for good\\nsuperiors, peers, and subordinates in a business organization).\\n\\nCritically consider, as well, the assumption that it is somehow\\nacceptable or even wise to slip by without paying your bills in full.\\nThis is another variant of the judgment of existence. “It does not\\nmatter if I take the easy path” begins with “It does not matter,” and\\nthat is Being, judged and damned, with a twist. The second part of\\nthe statement, “if I take the easy path,” is a self-imposed curse. If you\\ntake your turn at the difficult tasks, people learn to trust you, you\\nlearn to trust yourself, and you get better at doing difficult things. All\\nof that is good. If you leave all that undone, you will find yourself in\\nthe same position as the child whose parents insisted upon doing\\neverything for him or her: bereft of the capacity to thrive in the face\\nof the difficulties/challenges of life. “It does not matter if I take the\\neasy path,” is true only if there is no personality element of the\\nspeaker that could be called out by a true adventure. And those who\\navoid their destiny by standing back when asked to step forward also\\ndeprive everyone else of the advantages that may have come their\\nway had the person who took the easy way instead determined to be\\nall they could be.\\n\\nThe final form of sins of omission is associated with lack of faith in\\n\\nyourself—perhaps in humanity in general—because of the\\nfundamental nature of human vulnerability. There is a scene in the\\nbook of Genesis in which the scales fall from the eyes of Adam and\\nEve, and they realize they are vulnerable and naked—both part and\\nparcel of self-consciousness. At the same time, they develop the\\nknowledge of good and evil. These two developments coincide\\n\\n\\x0cbecause it is not possible to hurt other people with true effectiveness\\nuntil you know how you can be hurt yourself. And you do not know\\nthat you can be hurt until you are, more or less, fully self-conscious;\\nuntil you know that you can suffer excruciating pain; until you know\\nthat you can be killed; until you realize the limits of your being. And\\nas soon as you know all that, you have knowledge of your own\\nnakedness, and you can apply knowledge of that vulnerability with\\nmalevolent intent to other people. And then you understand and are\\ncapable of Good and Evil.\\n\\nWhen called upon later to account for his behavior—for eating of\\nthe forbidden fruit—Adam blames the woman for the development of\\nhis painful self-knowledge, and God for making her, saying as he\\ndoes, “The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of\\nthe tree, and I did eat” (Genesis 3:12). The first man’s refusal to take\\nresponsibility for his actions is associated with resentment (for his\\nacquisition of painful knowledge), deceit (as he knows he made a free\\nchoice, regardless of his wife’s behavior), and arrogance (he dares to\\nblame God and the woman the divinity created). Adam takes the easy\\nway out—just as you might, when you say to yourself, “I do not need\\nto have this fight with my wife. I do not have to stand up to my\\ntyrannical boss. I do not have to live by what I believe to be true. I\\ncan get away with avoiding my responsibilities.” Some of that is\\ninertia and cowardice, but some of it is also motivated by a deep\\nsense of disbelief in your own personal ability. Like Adam, you know\\nyou are naked. You are intimately aware of your flaws and\\nvulnerabilities, and the faith in yourself dissolves. This is\\nunderstandable, but neither helpful nor, in the final analysis,\\nexcusable.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nAs Proverbs 9:10 has it: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of\\nwisdom.” The connection between deception and the deepest of\\norienting instincts can be profitably comprehended in light of that. If\\nyou understand that deception corrupts and distorts the function of\\nthe most fundamental instinct that guides you through the\\n\\n\\x0cdifficulties of life, that prospect should scare you enough so that you\\nremain careful in what you say and do. A truthful person can rely on\\nhis or her innate sense of meaning and truth as a reliable guide to the\\nchoices that must be made through life’s days, weeks, and years. But\\nthere is a rule that applies—the same rule that computer\\nprogrammers well know: “garbage in, garbage out.” If you deceive\\n(particularly yourself), if you lie, then you begin to warp the\\nmechanisms guiding the instinct that orients you. That instinct is an\\nunconscious guide, so it works underneath your cognitive apparatus,\\nespecially once it has become habitual. If you rewire the unconscious\\nmechanisms that maintain you with assumptions derived from\\nsomething you know to be unreal, then your meaningful instinct will\\ntake you places you should not go, in proportion to its corruption.\\nThere is little more terrifying than the possibility that you could\\ncome to a crisis point in your life when you need every faculty you\\npossess, at that moment, to make the decision properly, only to find\\nyou have pathologized yourself with deceit and can no longer rely on\\nyour own judgment. Good luck to you, because nothing but luck will\\nthen serve to save you.\\n\\nThere is a sin somewhat mysteriously defined by Christ as\\n\\nunforgivable: “Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall\\nnot be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to\\ncome” (Matthew 12:32). St. Paul, one of Christianity’s founders, shed\\nsome light on this statement, when he associated that Third Person\\nof the Trinity with conscience: “I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my\\nconscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost” (Romans 9:1).\\nConscience is no less than the sharing of moral knowledge with the\\nself. Deceit necessitates voluntary refusal to abide by the dictate of\\nconscience, and risks pathologizing that very vital function. There is\\nno walking away from that corruption unscathed. This is true even in\\na neurological sense. Drugs of addiction are generally characterized\\nby their effects upon the neurotransmitter dopamine, increasing its\\neffects in some manner. Dopamine essentially produces the pleasure\\nassociated with hope or possibility. Furthermore, your brain is wired\\nso that if you do something that feels good (and therefore produces a\\ndopamine kick) then the parts of you that played a role in the action\\nunder question become stronger, more dominant, more able to\\ninhibit the function of other parts of your being. Continued use of an\\naddictive drug therefore feeds the growth of what can be accurately\\n\\n\\x0cconceptualized as a living monster in the user’s psyche—and the\\nattention and intention of that monster is single-mindedly devoted to\\nthe drug’s effect. It wants one thing, and it comes armed with an\\nentire philosophy about why that one thing must be considered of\\nprimary import.\\n\\nImagine you are recovering, fragilely, from addiction. Something\\ngoes wrong in your life. Resentment emerges. You think, “Oh, to hell\\nwith it!” as the initial event leading to reuse of the drug, and the\\nexperience of the subsequent dopamine hit. In consequence, the little\\ncircuits that formulate the thought “to hell with it” grow more\\npowerful than the parts of the addict’s psyche that might be\\nmotivating refusal to use the drug. “To hell with it” is a multifaceted\\nphilosophy. It means “This is worth sacrificing anything for.” It\\nmeans “Who cares about my life. It is not worth anything, anyway.”\\nIt means “I do not care if I have to lie to those who love me—my\\nparents, my wife and children—because what difference does it\\nmake, anyway? What I want is the drug.” There is no easy coming\\nback from that.\\n\\nWhen you habitually engage in deceit, you build a structure much\\n\\nlike the one that perpetuates addiction, especially if you get away\\nwith it, however briefly. The success of the lie is rewarding—and if\\nthe risks were high, and you are not caught out, that successful\\nreward might well be intense. This reinforces the development of the\\nneural mechanism in your brain comprising the structure of the\\nentire system of deception. With continued success, at least in the\\nshort term, this mechanism begins to work with increasing\\nautomaticity—and comes to act, in its arrogant manner, knowing\\nthat it can get away with it. That is more obvious for sins of\\ncommission; but it is equally and more dangerously and subtly true\\nfor what you could know but refuse to—sins of omission. That is the\\narrogance of believing that what you know is sufficient (regardless of\\nthe evidence that accumulates around you, in the form of suffering,\\nwhich is all too easily and archetypally, let us say, blamed on the\\nstructure of reality and the apparent insufficiency of God).\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\n\\x0cIt is in our individual capacity to confront the potential of the future\\nand to transform it into the actuality of the present. The way we\\ndetermine what it is that the world transforms into is a consequence\\nof our ethical, conscious choices. We wake up in the morning and\\nconfront the day, with all its possibilities and terrors. We chart a\\ncourse, making decisions for better or worse. We understand full well\\nthat we can do evil and bring terrible things into Being. But we also\\nknow that we can do good, if not great, things. We have the best\\nchance of doing the latter if we act properly, as a consequence of\\nbeing truthful, responsible, grateful, and humble.\\n\\nThe right attitude to the horror of existence—the alternative to\\nresentment, deceit, and arrogance—is the assumption that there is\\nenough of you, society, and the world to justify existence. That is\\nfaith in yourself, your fellow man, and the structure of existence\\nitself: the belief that there is enough to you to contend with existence\\nand transform your life into the best it could be. Perhaps you could\\nlive in a manner whose nobility, grandeur, and intrinsic meaning\\nwould be of sufficient import that you could tolerate the negative\\nelements of existence without becoming so bitter as to transform\\neverything around you into something resembling hell.\\n\\nOf course, we are oppressed by the fundamental uncertainty of\\nBeing. Of course, nature does us in, in unjust and painful ways. Of\\ncourse, our societies tend toward tyranny, and our individual psyches\\ntoward evil. But that does not mean we cannot be good, that our\\nsocieties cannot be just, and that the natural world cannot array itself\\nin our favor. What if we could constrain our malevolence a bit more,\\nserve and transform our institutions more responsibly, and be less\\nresentful? God only knows what the ultimate limit to that might be.\\nHow much better could things become if we all avoided the\\ntemptation to actively or passively warp the structure of existence; if\\nwe replaced anger with the vicissitudes of Being with gratitude and\\ntruth? And if we all did that, with diligent and continual purpose,\\nwould we not have the best chance of keeping at bay those elements\\nof self, state, and nature that manifest themselves so destructively\\nand cruelly, and that motivate our turning against the world?\\n\\nDo not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nBE GRATEFUL IN SPITE OF YOUR SUFFERING\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\n\\nI have been searching for decades for certainty. It has not been solely\\na matter of thinking, in the creative sense, but of thinking and then\\nattempting to undermine and destroy those thoughts, followed by\\ncareful consideration and conservation of those that survive. It is\\nidentification of a path forward through a swampy passage,\\nsearching for stones to stand on safely below the murky surface.\\nHowever, even though I regard the inevitability of suffering and its\\nexaggeration by malevolence as unshakable existential truths, I\\nbelieve even more deeply that people have the ability to transcend\\ntheir suffering, psychologically and practically, and to constrain their\\nown malevolence, as well as the evils that characterize the social and\\nthe natural worlds.\\n\\nHuman beings have the capacity to courageously confront their\\nsuffering—to transcend it psychologically, as well as to ameliorate it\\npractically. This is the most fundamental twin axiom of\\npsychotherapy, regardless of school of thought, as well as key to the\\nmystery of human success and progress across history itself. If you\\nconfront the limitations of life courageously, that provides you with a\\ncertain psychological purpose that serves as an antidote to the\\nsuffering. The fact of your voluntary focus on the abyss, so to speak,\\nindicates to yourself at the deepest of levels that you are capable of\\ntaking on without avoidance the difficulties of existence and the\\nresponsibility attendant upon that. That mere act of courage is\\ndeeply reassuring at the most fundamental levels of psychological\\nbeing. It indicates your capability and competence to those deep,\\n\\n\\x0cancient, and somewhat independent biological and psychological\\nalarm systems that register the danger of the world.\\n\\nBut the utility of such confrontation is by no means merely\\n\\npsychological, as important as that is. It is the appropriate pragmatic\\napproach as well: If you act nobly—a word that is very rarely used\\nnow, unfortunately—in the face of suffering, you can work practically\\nand effectively to ameliorate and rectify your own and other people’s\\nmisery, as such. You can make the material world—the real world—\\nbetter (or at least stop it from getting worse). The same goes for\\nmalevolence: you can constrain that within yourself. When you are\\nabout to say something, your conscience might (often does) inform\\nyou, noting, “That is not true.” It might present itself as an actual\\nvoice (internal, of course) or a feeling of shame, guilt, weakness, or\\nother inner disunity—the physiological consequence of the duality of\\npsyche you are manifesting. You then have the opportunity to cease\\nuttering those words. If you cannot tell the truth, you can at least not\\nconsciously lie.1 That is part of the constraint of malevolence. That is\\nsomething within our grasp. Beginning to cease knowingly lying is a\\nmajor step in the right direction.\\n\\nWe can constrain our suffering, and we can face it psychologically.\\n\\nThat makes us courageous. Then we can ameliorate it practically,\\nbecause that is what we do when we care for ourselves and other\\npeople. There seems to be almost no limit to that. You can genuinely\\nand competently come to care for yourself and your family. You can\\nthen extend that out into the broader community. Some people\\nbecome unbelievably good at that. People who work in palliative care\\nconstitute a prime example. They work continually, caring for people\\nwho are suffering and dying, and they lose some of those people\\nevery day. But they manage to get out of bed every morning, go to\\nwork, and face all that pain, tragedy, and death. They make a\\ndifference under virtually impossible circumstances. It is for such\\nreasons and because of such examples—watching people confront\\nthe existential catastrophe of life forthrightly and effectively—that I\\nam more optimistic than pessimistic, and that I believe that\\noptimism is, fundamentally, more reliable than pessimism. To come\\nto such a conclusion, and then to find it unshakable, is a good\\nexample of how and why it may be necessary to encounter the\\ndarkness before you can see the light. It is easy to be optimistic and\\nnaive. It is easy for optimism to be undermined and demolished,\\n\\n\\x0chowever, if it is naive, and for cynicism to arise in its place. But the\\nact of peering into the darkness as deeply as possible reveals a light\\nthat appears unquenchable, and that is a profound surprise, as well\\nas a great relief.\\n\\nThe same holds true for the issue of gratitude. I do not believe you\\ncan be appropriately grateful or thankful for what good you have and\\nfor what evil has not befallen you until you have some profound and\\neven terrifying sense of the weight of existence. You cannot properly\\nappreciate what you have unless you have some sense not only of\\nhow terrible things could be, but of how terrible it is likely for things\\nto be, given how easy it is for things to be so. This is something that\\nis very much worth knowing. Otherwise you might find yourself\\ntempted to ask, “Why would I ever look into the darkness?” But we\\nseem positively drawn to look. We are fascinated by evil. We watch\\ndramatic representations of serial killers, psychopaths, and the kings\\nof organized crime, gang members, rapists, contract killers, and\\nspies. We voluntarily frighten and disgust ourselves with thrillers\\nand horror films—and it is more than prurient curiosity. It is the\\ndevelopment of some understanding of the essentially moral\\nstructure of human existence, of our suspension between the poles of\\ngood and evil. The development of that understanding is necessary;\\nit places a down below us and an up above us, and orients us in\\nperception, motivation, and action. It protects us, as well. If you fail\\nto understand evil, then you have laid yourself bare to it. You are\\nsusceptible to its effects, or to its will. If you ever encounter someone\\nwho is malevolent, they have control over you in precise proportion\\nto the extent that you are unwilling or unable to understand them.\\nThus, you look in dark places to protect yourself, in case the darkness\\never appears, as well as to find the light. There is real utility in that.\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThe great German writer Goethe, who is to Germanic culture what\\nShakespeare is to English, wrote a famous play, Faust, the story of a\\nman who sells his soul to the devil for knowledge.2 Mephistopheles is\\nthe devil in Goethe’s play—the adversary. The adversary is a mythical\\nfigure; the spirit who eternally works against our positive intent (or,\\nperhaps, against positive intent generally). You can understand that\\n\\n\\x0cpsychologically, as well as metaphysically or religiously. We all see\\nwithin ourselves the emergence of good intentions and the repeated\\ninstructions to ourselves to act accordingly, yet we note distressingly\\noften that we leave undone what we know we should do, and do\\ninstead what we know we should not. There is something in all of us\\nthat works in counterposition to our voluntarily expressed desires.\\nThere are in fact many such somethings—a chorus of demons, so to\\nspeak—working at cross-purposes even to each other; many dark and\\nunarticulated motivations and systems of belief, all manifesting\\nthemselves as partial personalities (but with all the essential features\\nof personality, despite their partial nature).\\n\\nTo realize this is uncanny. That realization is the great\\n\\ncontribution of the psychoanalysts, who insisted above all, perhaps,\\nthat we were inhabited by spirits that were beyond not only our\\ncontrol but even our conscious knowledge. And that realization\\nbrings up great and paralyzing questions: If you are not in control of\\nyourself, who or what is? If you are not, a challenge has been posed\\nto the very idea of the centrality, unity, and even reality of the “you”\\nwhose existence seems so immediately certain. And what is that who\\nor what that is not you up to? And toward what end is it acting? We\\nall hope we are the sorts of creatures who can tell ourselves what to\\ndo, and who will then do exactly that, in accordance with our will.\\nYou are you, after all, and you should—virtually by definition—be in\\ncontrol of yourself. But things often do not work that way, and the\\nreason or reasons they do not are deeply mysterious.\\n\\nSometimes, of course, it is simply much easier just not to do the\\n\\nthings we should. Good actions can be and often are difficult to\\nundertake, and there is danger—exhaustion not the least of it—in\\ndifficulty. Inertia is also a powerful reason for stasis and can provide\\na certain immediate safety. But there is more to the problem. It is not\\njust that you are lazy: it is also that you are bad—and declared so by\\nyour own judgment. That is a very unpleasant realization, but there\\nis no hope of becoming good without it. You will upbraid yourself (or\\nyour conscience will do so) for your shortcomings. You will treat\\nyourself as if you were or are at least in part an immoral agent. That\\nis all deeply unpleasant too, and you might well be motivated to\\navoid your own judgment. But no simple rationalizations will allow\\nfor your escape.\\n\\n\\x0cYou will see, if you are willing to look, the adversarial force at work\\n\\nwithin you, working to undermine your best intentions. The exact\\nnature of that force is grounds for endless speculation—\\nphilosophical, literary, psychological, and above all, religious or\\ntheological. The Christian conception of the great figure of evil—\\nMephistopheles, Satan, Lucifer, the devil himself—is, for example, a\\nprofound imaginative personification of that spirit. But the adversary\\nis not merely something that exists in the imagination—certainly not\\nonly in the individual imagination. It is also something that\\nmanifests itself through something that is still aptly described as\\n“possession” in the motivation for malevolent actions, as well as in\\nthe acts themselves. Everyone who has thought or said something\\nakin to “I do not understand what came over me” after acting in a\\nparticularly unseemly manner notes the existence of such\\npossession, even if they cannot or do not articulate that noting. In\\nconsequence, we may ask ourselves, in utter dismay, “Why would\\nsuch a spirit exist? Why would it be part of each of us?”\\n\\nThe answer appears to be partly associated with the powerful\\nsense that each of us shares of our own intrinsic mortal limitations,\\nour subjugation to the suffering inflicted upon us by ourselves,\\nsociety, and nature. That embitters and produces a certain self-\\ncontempt or disgust, inspired by our own weaknesses and\\ninadequacies (and I am not speaking here yet of immorality, merely\\nof our intrinsic and terrible fragility), and also by the apparent\\nunfairness, unpredictability, and arbitrariness of our failings. Given\\nall these disappointing realizations, there is no reason to assume that\\nyou are going to be satisfied or happy with yourself, or with Being\\nitself. Such dissatisfaction—such unhappiness—can easily come to\\nreinforce and magnify itself in a vicious circle. With each step you\\ntake against yourself or others as a consequence of your unhappiness\\nand resentment, there is more to be ashamed of, and more reason for\\nself-directed antagonism. It is not for nothing that approximately\\none person in five engages in some form of serious physical self-\\nharm in their lifetime.3 And this does not include the most serious\\nact—suicide itself (or the more common tendency toward suicidal\\nideation). If you are unhappy with yourself, why would you work in\\nyour best interest? Maybe something vengeful would emerge from\\nyou, instead; maybe something capable of justifying itself while it\\nmetes out hypothetically deserved suffering, designed to interfere\\n\\n\\x0cwith your movement forward. If you conceptually aggregate and\\nunite into a single personality all that opposes you in you, all that\\nopposes your friendships, and all that opposes your wife or husband,\\nthe adversary emerges. That is precisely Mephistopheles in Goethe’s\\nplay—the devil himself. That is the spirit who works against—and\\nthat is exactly how he describes himself: “I am the spirit that\\ndenies.”4 Why? Because everything in the world is so limited and\\nimperfect—and causes itself so much trouble and terror because of\\nthat—that its annihilation is not only justified but ethically\\ndemanded. So goes, at least, the rationalization.\\n\\nThis is no mere lifeless abstraction. People struggle in a deadly\\n\\nfashion with such ideas. Women wrestle with them when they\\nconsider having a baby, inquiring of themselves: “Should I really\\nbring an infant into a world like this? Is that an ethical decision?”\\nThe followers of the philosophical school of antinatalism, of whom\\nthe South African philosopher David Benatar is perhaps the leading\\nadvocate,5 would decisively answer no to both of those questions. I\\ndebated his views with him a few years back.6 It was not as if I failed\\nto understand his position. There is no doubt that the world is\\nsteeped in suffering. A few years later, I debated another\\nphilosopher, Slavoj Žižek—known much more widely for his Marxist\\npredilections than his religious convictions. He said something\\nduring our discussion that might be theologically debatable, but that\\nI found of great interest. In the Christian tradition, even God\\nHimself, in the form of Christ, despairs of the meaning of life and the\\ngoodness of His Father in the agony of His Crucifixion. At the peak of\\nhis suffering, just before death, He utters the words “Eli Eli lama\\nsabachthani”7—“My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?”\\n(Matthew 27:46). This appears to strongly imply, in its narrative\\nway, that the burden of life can become so great that even God\\nHimself can lose faith when confronted with the unbearable reality of\\ninjustice, betrayal, suffering, and death.\\n\\nIt is hard to imagine a story more sympathetic to mere mortals. If\\n\\nGod Himself experiences doubts in the midst of His self-imposed\\nagony, how could we mere humans not fall prey to the same failing?\\nAnd it is possible that it was compassion that was driving the\\nantinatalist Benatar’s position. I saw no evidence that Benatar was\\nmalevolent in any obvious manner. He appeared to truly believe—in\\na manner I found reminiscent of Goethe’s Mephistopheles—that the\\n\\n\\x0ccombination of consciousness, vulnerability, and mortality is so dire\\nthat there is simply no moral excuse for its continuance. Now, it is\\nentirely possible that Mephistopheles’s opinion is not to be trusted.\\nSince he is Satan himself, there is no reason to assume that the\\nargument he puts forward to justify his adversarial stance toward\\nBeing is valid, or even that he himself truly believes it. And perhaps\\nthe same was true of Benatar, who was and is no doubt prey to the\\nfrailties that characterize each of us (and that certainly includes me,\\ndespite the stance I took in opposition to him). But I believed then\\nand still firmly believe now that the consequences of his self-negating\\nposition are simply too dire. It leads directly to an antilife or even an\\nanti-Being nihilism so profound that its manifestation could not help\\nbut exaggerate and amplify the destructive consequences of existence\\nthat are already the focus of the hypothetically compassionate\\nantinatalists themselves (and I am not being sarcastic or cynical\\nabout the existence of that compassion, misplaced though I believe it\\nto be).\\n\\nBenatar’s hypothesis was that life is so rife with suffering that it is,\\n\\nactually, a sin—for all intents and purposes—to bring any new\\nconscious beings into existence, and that the most appropriate\\nethical action for human beings to take would be to simply stop\\ndoing so: to render ourselves voluntarily extinct. Such a viewpoint is\\nmore widespread, in my opinion, than you might think, although\\nperhaps rarely held for long. Whenever you are cut off at the knees\\nby one of life’s many catastrophes, whenever a dream collapses, or\\nsomeone close to you is hurt in some fundamental way—especially a\\nchild or another loved one—then you can easily find yourself\\nthinking, “Perhaps it would be better if the whole mess was just\\nbrought to a halt.”\\n\\nThat is certainly what people think when they contemplate\\n\\nsuicide. Such thoughts are generated in their most extreme variant\\nby the serial killers, by high school shooters, by all generally\\nhomicidal and genocidal actors. They are acting out the adversarial\\nattitude as fully as they might. They are truly possessed, in a manner\\nthat exceeds the merely metaphorical. They have decided not only\\nthat life is unbearable and the malevolence of existence is\\ninexcusable, but that everything should be punished for the mere sin\\nof its Being. If we want to have any hope of dealing with the existence\\nof evil, and working toward its minimization, we must understand\\n\\n\\x0cthese sorts of impulses. It is in no small part the consciousness of\\nsuffering and malevolence that embitters people. And it is toward\\nthis embitterment that I believe the antinatalist position would, if\\nwidely adopted, inevitably drift. First, it might be the mere refusal to\\nreproduce. But I cannot believe that it would be long until that\\nimpulse to cease production of new life was transformed into a\\nsimilar impulse to destroy life that currently exists, in consequence\\nof the “compassionate” judgment that some lives are so terrible that\\nit is merciful to bring them to an end. That philosophy emerged\\nrelatively early in the Nazi era, for example, when individuals judged\\nunbearably damaged by life were euthanized for purposes deemed\\n“morally merciful.” The question this line of thinking leads to is\\nwhere does such “mercy” stop? How sick, old, intellectually\\nimpaired, crippled, unhappy, unproductive, or politically\\ninappropriate do you have to be before dispensing with you is a\\nmoral imperative? And why would you believe, once the eradication\\nor even merely the limitation of life became your guiding star, that\\nyou would not continue down that road to its hellish end?\\n\\nI found the Columbine High School killers’ writings particularly\\ninstructive in that regard. They are scrawled out, and are careless,\\nincoherent, and narcissistic, but there is definitely a philosophy at\\nthe base of them: that things deserve to suffer for the crime of their\\nexistence. The consequence of that belief is the creative elaboration\\nand extension of that suffering. One of the killers wrote that he\\nconsidered himself the judge of all that exists—a judge that found\\nBeing, particularly of the human form, wanting—and that it would be\\nbetter if the entire human race was eradicated. That defined the\\nscope of his horrific vision. He and his partner shot their classmates\\nin their local high school, but that was only a tiny fraction of what\\nthey were planning. They had incendiary devices laid out across the\\ncommunity, and had fantasized together about trying to take out the\\nentire city. Such plans are just a step on the way to the ultimate\\ngenocidal vision.\\n\\nYou do not have those sorts of visions unless you are deeply\\n\\npossessed by something very much resembling the adversarial spirit.\\nThat is Mephistopheles, whose essential viewpoint might be\\nparaphrased as follows: “Life is so terrible, because of its limitations\\nand malevolence, that it would be better if it did not exist at all.” That\\nis the central doctrine of the spirit that works at counterpurposes to\\n\\n\\x0cyou. It is an arguable case and not surprising that it should emerge,\\nand it seems terribly credible at moments of crisis, even though I\\nbelieve it is deeply wrong. I think the reason that it is wrong, in part,\\nis because, when it is realized, all it does is exacerbate an already\\nadmittedly bad situation. If you set about making things worse, they\\nare likely, in fact, to get worse. I cannot see how this constitutes an\\nimprovement, if your original objection was motivated by the\\nessential terror of our existential situation itself. It does not seem to\\nbe a pathway that a conscious creature, with a bit of gratitude, might\\nwalk down. There is an incoherency to it that is logically untenable,\\nand that therefore seems to make the argument fundamentally\\nspecious, and cannot help but make the listener think, “There are\\nthings going on here behind the scenes that are both unspoken and\\nunspeakable, despite the surface logic.”\\n\\nThe failings in the adversary’s logic do not mean that constructing\\nan unshakable viewpoint to counter it is a simple matter. In the most\\nstraightforward sense, identifying that vision of objection and\\nvengefulness is useful, in the way that negative space in a painting is\\nuseful: it defines the positive, by contrast. Good can be\\nconceptualized—however vaguely in its initial formulation—as the\\nopposite of whatever constitutes evil, which is usually more readily\\nidentifiable in the world than goodness. I have been trying to find\\ntouchstones on that pathway of opposition to evil, so that people can\\nidentify what that good might be. Some of these are very practical, if\\ndifficult. I have been suggesting to my viewers and listeners,8 for\\nexample—particularly those currently burdened by the mortal illness\\nof a parent—that it is useful to consciously take on the task of being\\nthe most reliable person in the aftermath of the death, during the\\ngrief-stricken preparations for the funeral and the funeral itself, and\\nfor the care of family members during and after the catastrophe.\\nThere is a call to your potential in doing that. There is a call to the\\nstrength of Being itself—the Being that could manifest itself in you.\\nThe human race has been dealing with loss and death forever. We are\\nthe descendants of those who could manage it. That capability is\\nwithin us, grim as the task might seem.\\n\\nIf you truly love someone, it can seem a deep form of betrayal to\\n\\nstay integrated and healthy, in essence, in their absence or sadly\\nwaning presence. What does that ability indicate, after all, about the\\ntrue depths of your love? If you can witness their demise and survive\\n\\n\\x0cthe loss, does that not imply that the bond was shallow and\\ntemporary, and even replaceable? If you were truly bonded, should\\nnot it destroy you (as it sometimes does)? But we cannot wish that\\nevery inevitable loss leads to the destruction of everyone affected,\\nbecause we would then all be doomed, far more immediately than we\\ncurrently are. And it certainly is not the case that the last wish of the\\ndying is or should be the interminable suffering of those they love.\\nMy impression has been, instead, that people tend to feel guilty on\\ntheir deathbeds (because of their immediate uselessness and the\\nburden that causes, but even more because of their apprehension\\nabout the grief and trouble they will cause those left behind). Thus,\\ntheir most fervent wish, I believe, is that those whom they love will\\nbe able to move forward and live happily, after a reasonable time of\\nmourning.\\n\\nTo collapse in the aftermath of a tragic loss is therefore more\\n\\naccurately a betrayal of the person who has died, instead of a tribute,\\nas it multiplies the effect of that mortal catastrophe. It takes a dying\\nperson of narcissistic selfishness to wish endless grief on their loved\\nones. Strength in the face of death is better for the person who is\\ndying and for those who remain living alike. There are family\\nmembers who are suffering because of their loss who need taking\\ncare of, and who may be too old and infirm and otherwise troubled to\\ncope with the situation properly. And so someone strong has to step\\nin and exercise the terrible authority that makes even of death\\nsomething to face and overcome. To understand clearly that you are\\nmorally obliged under such circumstances to manifest strength in the\\nface of adversity is to indicate to yourself—and, perhaps, to other\\npeople—that there is something in you of sufficient grandeur and\\npower to face the worst forthrightly and to yet prevail. That is\\ncertainly what people need to encounter at a funeral. There is little to\\nsay, explicitly, in the face of death. Everyone is rendered speechless\\nwhen they encounter the infinite expanse of emptiness surrounding\\nour too-brief existence. But uprightness and courage in such a\\nsituation is truly heartening and sustaining.\\n\\nI have suggested that strength at the funeral of someone dear and\\nclose is a worthy goal more than once during a lecture (where people\\nmight encounter it live, or on YouTube or a podcast). In\\nconsequence, a not insignificant number of people have indicated to\\nme that they took heart in desperate times as a consequence. They\\n\\n\\x0cset reliability and strength in a crisis as a conscious goal and were\\nable to manage exactly that, so that the devastated people around\\nthem had someone to lean on and see as an example in the face of\\ngenuine trouble. That, at the very least, made a bad situation much\\nless dreadful than it might have been. And that is something. If you\\ncan observe someone rising above the catastrophe, loss, bitterness,\\nand despair, then you see evidence that such a response to\\ncatastrophe is possible. In consequence, you might mimic that, even\\nunder dire circumstances. Courage and nobility in the face of tragedy\\nis the reverse of the destructive, nihilistic cynicism apparently\\njustified under just such circumstances.\\n\\nAgain, I understand the negative attitude. I have had thousands\\n\\nhours of clinical experience. I have been deeply involved in some\\nvery difficult situations, along with those I was listening to and\\nstrategizing with, as well as within the confines of my private life.\\nPeople have arduous lives. You think your life is hard (and it\\nprobably is, at least at times), then you meet someone and your life is\\nso much better than theirs that, no matter what your hardships are,\\nyou cannot even conceive of how they might continue to exist in their\\ncurrent misery. And you find out, not infrequently, that those same\\nunfortunate people know someone else whose life is so hard that they\\nfeel the same way about them. And even they are often left feeling\\nguilty that they believe what they have is a hard lot, because they\\nknow just how much worse it could be.\\n\\nIt is not as if the suffering and betrayal, the catastrophes, are of\\ninsufficient gravity to make bitterness a real option. But there is just\\nno good whatsoever in that option, and plenty of evident harm. So,\\nwhat constitutes the alternative? I began to seriously contemplate\\nthe topic of this rule just before Thanksgiving, in 2018, when I was\\ntouring the United States. That holiday has become, arguably, the\\nbiggest shared celebration in America (and is also a major event in\\nCanada, approximately a month earlier). The only competitor,\\nparticularly since Easter has largely faded away, is Christmas, which\\nis also in some sense a holiday of thanksgiving, concentrating as it\\ndoes on the arrival of the eternal Redeemer in the midst of the\\ndarkness and cold of winter, and so reflects the endless birth and\\nrebirth of hope itself. The giving of thanks is an alternative to\\nbitterness—perhaps the alternative. My observation of American\\nholidays—I lived in the States for seven years, and I have spent time\\n\\n\\x0cthere on countless other occasions—is that the prominence of\\nThanksgiving among holidays seems to be a good thing, practically\\nand symbolically. The fact that the primary feast of celebration\\ncharacterizing a country would be one of explicitly “giving thanks”\\nappears, in principle, as a positive commentary on the fundamental\\nethic of the state. It means that the individual is striving to have his\\nor her heart in the right place, and that the group is supporting and\\nencouraging that endeavor. Why is that, given the trouble that\\nconstitutes life? It is because you can be courageous. You can be\\nalert, awake, attentive. You can see how demanding life is and can\\nbe, and you can see it clearly. Despite this, you can remain grateful,\\nbecause that is the intrepid attitude toward life and its difficulties.\\nYou are grateful not because you are naive, but because you have\\ndecided to put a hand forward to encourage the best in yourself, and\\nthe state, and the world. You are grateful, in the same manner, not\\nbecause suffering is absent, but because it is valiant to remember\\nwhat you have and what you may still be offered—and because the\\nproper thankful attitude toward that existence and possibility\\npositions you better than any other attitude toward the vicissitudes\\nof existence.\\n\\nTo be grateful for your family is to remember to treat them better.\\n\\nThey could cease to exist at any moment. To be grateful for your\\nfriends is to awaken yourself to the necessity of treating them\\nproperly, given the comparative unlikelihood of friendship itself. To\\nbe grateful to your society is to remind yourself that you are the\\nbeneficiary of tremendous effort on the part of those who\\npredeceased us, and left this amazing framework of social structure,\\nritual, culture, art, technology, power, water, and sanitation so that\\nour lives could be better than theirs.\\n\\nThe temptation to become embittered is great and real. It requires\\n\\na genuine moral effort not to take that path, assuming that you are\\nnot—or are no longer—naive. The gratitude associated with that state\\nof Being is predicated on ignorance and inexperience. That is not\\nvirtue. Thus, if you are attentive and awake, and you can see the\\nstructure of the world, bitterness and resentment beckon as a viable\\nresponse. Then you might well ask yourself, “Well, why not walk\\ndown that dark path?” It seems to me that the answer to that, to state\\nit again, is courage: the courage to decide “No, that is not for me,\\ndespite the reasons I may have for being tempted in that direction,”\\n\\n\\x0cand to decide, instead, “Despite the burden of my awake mortality, I\\nam going to work for the good of the world.”\\n\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00—\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\nThat decision seems to me to be courage subsumed to love. If it is\\nresentment and bitterness and the consequent hatred that emerges\\nfrom that tempting us toward the torment and destruction of\\neverything that lives and suffers, then perhaps it is active love that\\naims at its betterment. And that seems to me to be the fundamental\\ndecision of life, and that it is correct to identify it, at least in a vital\\npart, as an act of voluntary will. The reasons for acrimony, anger,\\nresentment, and malevolence are strong and plentiful. Thus, it must\\nbe a leap of faith—a decision about a mode of being not so clearly\\njustified by the evidence, particularly in hard times—that Being\\nshould be strengthened and supported by your aims and your acts.\\nThat is something done in some deep sense despite “Eli Eli lama\\nsabachthani”—something that says “despite it all, no matter what it\\nis, onward and upward”—and that is precisely the impossible moral\\nundertaking that is demanded from each of us for the world to\\nfunction properly (even for it to avoid degeneration into hell).\\nIt is within the frame of that impossible undertaking—that\\n\\ndecision to love—that courage manifests itself, enabling each person\\nwho adopts the courageous pathway to do the difficult things that are\\nnecessary to act for the good in even the worst of times. If you\\ndetermine to manifest the two virtues of love and courage—\\nsimultaneously, consciously—you decide that you are going to work\\nto make things better and not worse, even for yourself, even though\\nyou know that because of all your errors and omissions you are\\nalready three-quarters lost.\\n\\nYou are going to work to make things better for yourself, as if you\\nare someone you are responsible for helping. You are going to do the\\nsame thing for your family and the broader community. You are\\ngoing to strive toward the harmony that could manifest itself at all\\nthose levels, despite the fact that you can see the flawed and\\ndamaged substructure of things, and have had your vision damaged\\nin consequence. That is the proper and courageous pathway forward.\\n\\n\\x0cMaybe that is the definition of gratitude, of thankfulness, and I\\ncannot see how that is separate from courage and love.\\n\\nYou might well ask, “Do people actually perceive and act in this\\nmanner?”—even—“Can they?” One of the most compelling pieces of\\nevidence I have come across is the fact of grief over the loss of\\nsomeone close. Even if you are ambivalent about life itself—and\\nmaybe even if you are ambivalent, to some degree, about the person\\nthat you lost, because that can certainly be the case—your likely\\nresponse to a death is grief. That response is not exactly conscious.\\nGrief is a strange experience. It seizes you unexpectedly. You feel\\nshock and confusion. You are not at all sure how to respond. What is\\nit that you are supposed to do? But if it is conscious grieving—the\\nvoluntary acting out of the supposedly appropriate response—it is\\nnot real; not in the manner that genuine grief grips you of its own\\naccord. And if you do not feel yourself seized, unwittingly, in the\\nlatter sense, you might think, “I am not feeling the way I am\\nsupposed to feel. I am not crying. I am not overwhelmed by sorrow. I\\nam going far too normally about my day-to-day business”\\n(something particularly likely to occur if you receive the news of a\\ndeath from a distant locale). But then, as you engage in something\\ntrivial, as if things are normal, the grief will strike you like a rogue\\nwave. That happens repeatedly, God only knows for how long. It is\\nsomething that arises from the depths, and it takes you irresistibly in\\nits grasp.\\n\\nGrief must be a reflection of love. It is perhaps the ultimate proof\\n\\nof love. Grief is an uncontrollable manifestation of your belief that\\nthe lost person’s existence, limited and flawed as it might have been,\\nwas worthwhile, despite the limitations and flaws even of life itself.\\nOtherwise, why would you feel the loss? Otherwise, why would you\\nfeel, involuntarily, sorrowful and bereft (and that from a source self-\\ndeception cannot reach)? You grieve because something that you\\nvalued is no longer in existence. Thus, in the core of your Being, you\\nhave decided that the person’s life was valuable, despite whatever\\ntrouble they caused you—and themselves. In my experience, that\\nhappens even when people die who were quite monstrous. It is a rare\\nperson whose life has gone so catastrophically wrong that their death\\nbrings no sorrow.\\n\\nThere is a deep part of us that makes the decision, when we grieve\\n\\nfor someone we have lost, that their existence was worthwhile,\\n\\n\\x0cdespite it all. Maybe that is a reflection of an even more fundamental\\ndecision: Being itself is worth having, despite it all. Gratitude is\\ntherefore the process of consciously and courageously attempting\\nthankfulness in the face of the catastrophe of life. Maybe that is what\\nwe are trying to do when we meet with our families during a holiday,\\nwedding, or funeral. Those are often contentious and difficult affairs.\\nWe face a paradoxical, demanding tension. We bring people that we\\nknow and love close to us; we are pleased at their existence and their\\nproximity, but also wish they could be more. We are inevitably\\ndisappointed in each other, and in ourselves, as well.\\n\\nIn any familial gathering, there is tension between the warmth you\\n\\nfeel and the bonding of memory and shared experience, and the\\nsorrow inevitably accompanying that. You see some relatives who are\\nin a counterproductive stasis, or wandering down a path that is not\\ngood for them. You see others aging, losing their vitality and health\\n(and that sight interferes with and disrupts your memories of their\\nmore powerful and youthful selves: a dual loss, then, of present and\\npast). That is all painful to perceive. But the fundamental conclusion,\\ndespite all of that, is that “It is good that we are all together and able\\nto share a meal, and to see and talk to each other, and to note that we\\nare all here and facing this celebration or difficulty together.” And\\neveryone hopes that “perhaps if we pull together, we can manage this\\nproperly.” And so you make the same fundamental decision, when\\nyou join communally with your people, that you make when you\\ngrieve: “Despite everything, it is good that we are together, and that\\nwe have one another.” That is something truly positive.\\n\\nThe same is true of your relationship with your children. My grief\\nat life in recent decades was exaggerated in the case of my daughter,\\nbecause she was very ill for many years as a child, adolescent, and\\nyoung adult. A child is a being of tremendous potential, capable of\\ndeveloping an admirable, productive, and ever-increasing autonomy\\nand ability. But there is also something truly fragile about their\\nthree- or four- or five- (or even fifteen- or twenty-five-) year-old\\nforms (because that fragility never truly disappears from a parent’s\\nperception, once it has been experienced deeply, as it certainly will\\nbe with the experience of caring for young children). All that is part\\nof the joy of having them, but also part of the pain. The pain is the\\nabsolute certainty that the fragility will be exploited. And yet I\\nthought that whatever steps I might take to eradicate that fragility in\\n\\n\\x0cmy children would also destroy that for which I was thankful. I\\nremember thinking this quite distinctly with my son when he was\\nthree, because he was supercute and fun. But he was three, so he was\\nlittle. He would collapse, bang his head on tables, fall down the\\nstairs, and get into little scraps with other kids. Maybe he would be\\nplaying in the supermarket parking lot and, distracted, run off\\nbriefly. This is not a wise move in a place ruled by cars. There is an\\nundeniable vulnerability around children that wakes you up and\\nmakes you very conscious of the desire to protect them, but also of\\nthe desire to foster their autonomy and push them out in the world,\\nbecause that is how you strengthen them. It is also a vulnerability\\nthat can make you angry at life because of its fragility, and lead you\\nto curse the fate that joins the two together.\\n\\nWhen I think about my parents, the same thing comes to mind.\\n\\nThey are getting old. As people get older, in some sense, you see\\nthem crystallize into the people that they are. My father and my\\nmother both have a decided character. They were who they were in\\ntheir fifties, and now they are perhaps even more so. They have their\\nlimitations and their advantages (and it is even the case that the\\nlatter are often integrally necessary to the former). They are in their\\neighties now and are very particularized. Sometimes it is frustrating\\nto deal with people and their particularities. You think, “Would not it\\nbe better if they could be some other way?” I am not saying I think\\nthat about my parents more than people generally think that about\\neach other. It is by no means a criticism of them. In addition, there is\\nno doubt that they (and others—many others) feel the same way\\nabout me. But it is necessary to understand that, just as in the case of\\nchildren, all those particularities, fragilities, and limitations are part\\nand parcel of what it is that you come to love.\\n\\nSo, you might love people despite their limitations, but you also\\nlove them because of their limitations. That is something very much\\nworth understanding. Doing so may help you see how gratitude\\nremains possible. Despite the fact that the world is a very dark place,\\nand that each of us has our black elements of soul, we see in each\\nother a unique blend of actuality and possibility that is a kind of\\nmiracle: one that can manifest itself, truly, in the world, in the\\nrelationships we have that are grounded in trust and love. That is\\nsomething for which you can be courageously thankful. That is\\n\\n\\x0csomething in which you can discover part of the antidote to the abyss\\nand the darkness.\\n\\nBe grateful in spite of your suffering.\\n\\n\\x0cCoda\\n\\nAs I indicated in the overture, much of this book was written during\\nlong months spent in hospitals—first, visiting or staying with my\\ndaughter, Mikhaila, then doing the same over a longer period with\\nmy wife, Tammy, and finally—when it became necessary—during my\\nrepeated admissions. I do not think it appropriate to write about\\nthose personal trials in any more detail than I already have in the\\nOverture—partly because the common circumstances of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic have rendered everyone’s life tragic in an unimaginable\\nmanner, so that it seems superfluous, in some sense, to provide a\\ndetailed account of familial or individual suffering on top of that, and\\npartly because the current book is not about my daughter’s troubles,\\nor my wife’s, or mine, directed as it is to topics of general\\npsychological import. What I truly find necessary to relate, however,\\nis our appreciation to all those many people who supported us during\\nthis trying time. So, some additional discussion of our various\\nmaladies appears unavoidable at this point.\\n\\nOn the public front, we received an outpouring of good wishes\\nfrom thousands of people who had become familiar with my work.\\nSome of this was delivered in person, when people met Tammy or\\nme in public; some was sent by email and social media; and some of\\nit came in YouTube comments on my videos. This was exceptionally\\nheartening. My sister, Bonnie, gathered and printed out particularly\\nthoughtful messages to Tammy from around the world, and posted\\nthem in bright colors on the walls of the hospital room where they\\ncould be easily seen. The messages later addressed to me helped\\nbolster my oft-wavering conviction that I could and should prevail in\\nthe face of the difficulties I was experiencing, and that the book you\\nare reading or listening to would maintain its relevance, even in the\\nface of the terrible pandemic that currently envelops the world. We\\nwere also the beneficiaries of medical care, much of it extreme, but\\n\\n\\x0cmost often provided with optimism, care, and competence. Tammy’s\\ndual cancer surgeries were courageously performed by Dr. Nathan\\nPerlis of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and when the\\ncomplications arising thereof became too extreme, was treated by Dr.\\nMaxim Itkin, director of Philadelphia’s Penn Center for Lymphatic\\nDisorders.\\n\\nMore privately, Tammy and I were individually and jointly the\\ngrateful beneficiaries of constant support from family and friends,\\nwho interrupted their lives to spend days, weeks, or months of time\\nwith us while we were undergoing our trials. I can only hope, in the\\nface of serious doubts about the matter, that I would have chosen to\\nbe as generous with my time and attention as they were if the tables\\nwere turned. It is particularly necessary to thank my family members\\n—my daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, and her husband, Andrey\\nKorikov; my son, Julian Peterson, and daughter-in-law, Jillian\\nVardy; my brother-in law and sister Jim and Bonnie Keller; my\\nbrother and sister-in-law Joel and Kathleen Peterson; my parents,\\nBeverley and Walter Peterson; my brother- and sister-in-law Dale\\nand Maureen Roberts, and their daughter, Tasha; my sister-in-law\\nDella Roberts and her husband, Daniel Grant; as well as our friends\\nWayne Meretsky, Myriam Mongrain, Queenie Yu, Morgan and Ava\\nAbbott, Wodek Szemberg and Estera Bekier, Wil Cunningham and\\nShona Tritt, Jim Balsillie and Neve Peric, Dr. Norman and Karen\\nDoidge, Gregg and Dr. Delinah Hurwitz (the former of whom also\\nprofoundly helped me edit and improve 12 Rules for Life: An\\nAntidote to Chaos), Dr. Cory and Nadine Torgerson, Sonia and\\nMarshall Tully, Dr. Robert O. and Sandra Pihl, Dr. Daniel Higgins\\nand Dr. Alice Lee, Dr. Mehmet and Lisa Oz, and Dr. Stephen and Dr.\\nNicole Blackwood, all of whom went above and beyond the call of\\nduty in the attention they paid to Tammy and me over the last two\\nyears. There are, finally, three men of God who were of service,\\nparticularly to Tammy: Fathers Eric Nicolai, Fred Dolan, and Walter\\nHannam.\\n\\nMy family made arrangements to have me treated in Moscow for\\nthe consequence of a paradoxical reaction and then a dependence on\\nthe hypothetically safe but truly dangerous benzodiazepine\\nantianxiety medication. This was arranged with exceptional\\nefficiency, despite the time of year (the Christmas and New Year\\nholidays in 2019–20), by Kirill Sergeevich Mikhailov, the consul\\n\\n\\x0cgeneral of the Russian Federation in Toronto, and the consular staff\\nwho provided an urgent visa in a matter of days. Many people,\\nincluding Kelly and Joe Craft, Anish Dwivedi, Jamil Javani, Zach\\nLahn, Chris Halverson, Metropolitan Jonah, and the V. Rev. Victor\\nPotapov and Dimitir Ivanov, helped expedite what was a very\\ncomplex, multidimensional process. While in Russia, my safety was\\nensured by Alexander Usov, and my sense of isolation diminished by\\ndaily visits by Mikhaila and her husband, Andrey, who truly cannot\\nbe thanked enough. The Russian medical teams included IMC\\nAddiction by Roman Yuzapolski, who agreed to supervise my case\\ndespite being advised by assorted experts that it was too dangerous\\nto do so, and his staff members, Herman Stepnov, administrative\\ndirectors, and Alexandr, therapist, who translated for me constantly\\nfor a two-week period, without even a change of clothes. The team of\\nthe Russian Academy of Medical Sciences took me in with\\nundiagnosed double pneumonia and in a state of catatonia and\\ndelirium, and restored my ability to ambulate. Dr. Marina Petrova,\\nthe deputy director, and Dr. Michael, the head doctor of what was\\nknown as the Reanimatology Ward, were of particular and notable\\naid. Uliana Efros, nanny to my granddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett,\\nalways had our backs and traveled with Mikhaila, Andrey, and me for\\neight months from Russia to Florida and Serbia, caring for Scarlett,\\nincluding spending a month in quarantine. Thanks as well to Uli’s\\ndaughter Liza Romanova, who helped take care of Scarlett in Russia,\\nso that my daughter and son-in-law could visit me in the hospital.\\nFinally, on the Russian end, I would like to thank Mikhail Avdeev,\\nwho helped us extensively with provision of medication and\\ntranslation of medical information—both on very short notice.\\nLater, in June 2020, I sought admission at the IM Clinic for\\n\\nInternal Medicine in Belgrade, an institution dedicated to\\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal, and fell directly under the competent\\nand caring treatment provided by Dr. Igor Bolbukh and his staff. Dr.\\nBolbukh had flown to Russia previously to consult there while I was\\nin a state of delirium, provided months of pro bono medical\\nguidance, moved me to a more stable condition when I arrived in\\nSerbia, and managed my care thereafter. The IM Clinic was founded\\nby Dr. Nikolai Vorobiev, and his staff were very patient, without\\nresentment—a difficult feat to manage in these days of COVID and\\nthe inevitable accompanying and sudden quarantines.\\n\\n\\x0cThere are also those who profoundly deserve credit, recognition,\\n\\nand gratitude on the professional front. Thank you to my agents,\\nMollie Glick of Creative Artists Agency, as well as Sally Harding of\\nCookeMcDermid (Canada) and her colleagues Suzanne Brandreth\\nand Hana El Niwairi of Cooke Agency International Canada. Thank\\nyou to the editors and publishers of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to\\nChaos: Penguin Random House Canada senior editor Craig Pyette,\\nwho played a diligent and instrumental role in quality control and\\nenhancement; former CEO Brad Martin; current CEO Kristin\\nCochrane; publisher of the Knopf Random House Canada Publishing\\nGroup Anne Collins; vice president, associate publisher, and director\\nof marketing strategy Scott Sellers; Penguin Random House UK\\neditor Laura Stickney and her colleague Penelope Vogler, and CEO\\nTom Weldon; and Penguin Random House International CEO\\nMarkus Dohle. Thanks to the editors and publishers of the current\\nbook, a group that includes the immediately aforementioned\\nindividuals, as well as additional Penguin Random House US\\npersonnel, including publisher of the Portfolio and Sentinel imprints\\nAdrian Zackheim and editor Helen Healey. Finally, thank you to\\nProfessor Bruce Pardy and lawyer Jared Brown for their active\\nsupport of my ideas during a time when doing so could be truly\\nhazardous to one’s professional reputation and security.\\n\\nThe worldwide tour of 160 cities that Tammy and I undertook\\nduring the incubation period of this book as well as its preliminary\\nformulation was organized with exceptional efficiency and good\\nnature by Creative Artists Agency representatives Justin Edbrooke\\n(assisted by Daniel Smith) and Ari Levin (assisted by Colette Silver),\\nas well as Live Nation’s Andrew Levitt. The Australian and New\\nZealand tour benefited from the attention of Australian producer\\nTEG Dainty’s Brad Drummond, tour manager Simon Christian, and\\nsecurity man Scott Nicholson. Gunnlaugur Jónsson and his crew\\nwere exceptionally hospitable to Tammy and me (as well as to my\\nmother and aunt, who accompanied us for the days we were in\\nIceland). John O’Connell served as primary tour manager, and was\\nextremely professional, great at problem solving, and consistently\\nupbeat and supportive over the months of travel and organization.\\n\\nDave Rubin of The Rubin Report traveled with us, introduced my\\nlectures, and emceed the question-and-answer periods that followed,\\nadding a necessary bit of levity to what might otherwise have been a\\n\\n\\x0ctoo-serious endeavor. Rob Greenwald of Rogers & Cowan helped\\nensure appropriate media coverage. Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro,\\nDouglas Murray, Gad Saad, and Steven Crowder extended their\\nfriendship and shared their extensive media presence. Zachary Lahn\\nwas there many times as needed, and Jeff Sandefer opened up his\\nextensive connection network. Bill Vardy, Dennis Thigpen, Duncan\\nMaisels, and Melanie Paquette served as drivers for the tour leg in\\nNorth America when we used motor homes. Tammy and I would also\\nlike to thank designer Shelley Kirsch and the crew at SJOC\\nConstruction for completing the renovation of our house during\\nthese trying times with minimal supervision on our part. So much\\nhas happened in the last three years I am sure that I have missed key\\npeople, and for that I sincerely apologize.\\n\\nThanks is due, finally, to all of you who have read or listened to my\\n\\nbooks—Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, as well as the\\ntwo 12 Rules volumes—and/or tuned in to my YouTube videos and\\npodcasts. I have been profoundly struck, as have the people close to\\nme, by the exceptional loyalty and care you have demonstrated over\\nthe last half decade. May all of you reading or listening to this book\\nwend your way successfully through these difficult times. I hope you\\nare surrounded by people you love and who love you in turn.

Furthermore, it becomes hyperexploratory. That’s truly staggering, in my\\nestimation. Think about it: if you surgically remove 95 percent of a cat’s brain, it cannot stop\\nexploring. You would think an essentially brainless cat would just sit there, but that’s not\\nwhat happens. The curious part of its brain is still there.\\n\\n\\x0c*I am aware, of course, that conservatives also have a proclivity to object to big government,\\nwhich seems to contradict the fundamental point I am making. But, in Western\\ndemocracies, that’s primarily because the faith that conservatives manifest in culture is\\npredicated more on the eternal verities of the Constitution and the more permanent\\nelements of government (so Culture with a capital “C”) than on the too variable and too\\nunpredictable whims of whomever might be elected presently, conservative or liberal.\\nLikewise, in the same democracies, the liberals tend to look to government for the solution\\nto the problems that concern them, but that’s because they believe more in the dynamism of\\nthe current crop of politicians (particularly, but not only, if they are liberal themselves) and\\nless in the eternal verities of the underlying structure.\\n\\n\\x0c*There is little doubt that we create a fair bit of “unnatural” mess while we are doing so\\n(another ideological idea, based as it is on the one-sided view of Nature as the victim of our\\nrapine and greed), but it’s not as if we are doing it for trivial reasons. That’s why I have some\\nsympathy for humanity, as well as for the individuals who compose the mass of humanity,\\nand why I cannot find it in my heart to forgive those who say foolish things such as “the\\nplanet would be better off if there were no people on it.” That’s the genocidal element of the\\nradical environmentalist ethos, and it’s a consequence of an ideology that sees only the\\nAdversary, the Authoritarian Tyrant, and the Benevolent Mother as the prime actors of\\nbeing. It’s something horrible to behold, if you think it through with any degree of depth.\\n\\n\\x0c*If I didn’t say it before, I can certainly say it now: I was and remain in constant awe as a\\nconsequence of the absolute courage and grace that my wife, for example, manifested in the\\nface of her trials in the first six months of 2019, after she was diagnosed with terminal\\ncancer (and perhaps cured). Shame, too . . . because I am not at all convinced that I could\\nhave done the same.\\n\\n\\x0c*I have modified the accounts drawn from my clinical practice enough to ensure the\\ncontinuing privacy of my clients while endeavoring to maintain the essential narrative truth\\nof what I am relating.\\n\\n\\x0c*“Out of many, one.”\\n\\n\\x0c*Even rats understand this. Jaak Panksepp, one of the founders of the psychological\\nsubfield called affective neuroscience and an extremely creative, courageous, and gifted\\nresearcher, spent many years analyzing the role of play in the development and socialization\\nof rats (see J. Panksepp, Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal\\nEmotions [New York: Oxford University Press, 1998], particularly the chapter on play, 280–\\n99). Rats like to play. They particularly enjoy rough-and-tumble play, particularly if they are\\nmale juvenile rats. They enjoy it so much that they will voluntarily work—pulling a lever\\nrepeatedly, say—to gain the opportunity to enter an arena where another juvenile waits to\\nplay. When two juvenile strangers meet for the first time in this situation, they size each\\nother up and then establish dominance. If one rat is only 10 percent larger than the other, he\\ncan pretty much win every physical contest, every rat wrestling match—but they still wrestle\\nto find out, and the larger rat almost inevitably pins the smaller. If you were inclined to view\\nthe establishment of hierarchy as equivalent to dominance by power, that would be game\\nover. The larger, more powerful rat won. End of story. But that is by no means the end of the\\nstory, unless the rats meet only once. Rats live in social environments, and they interact\\nwith the same individuals over and over. Thus, the game, once started, continues—and the\\nrules have to govern not so much the single game as the repeating one. Once dominance is\\nestablished, the rats can play—something they do in a manner very different from genuine\\nfighting (just like play fighting with a pet dog is very different from being attacked by a dog).\\nNow, the larger rat could pin the smaller rat every time. However, that breaks the rules\\n(really, the meta-rules: those that are observable only over the course of repeated games).\\nThe purpose of the repeated game is not dominance, but continuing play. This is not to say\\nthat the initial dominance is without significance. It matters, not least in the following\\nmanner: When the two rats meet a second time, they will both adopt a unique role. The\\nsmaller rat is now duty bound to invite his larger friend to play, and the larger rat is duty\\nbound to accept the invitation. The former will jump around playfully, to indicate his intent.\\nThe larger rat might hang back and act cool and a bit dismissive (as is now his prerogative);\\nbut if he’s a decent sort he will join in the fun, as in his heart of hearts he truly wants to play.\\nHowever—and this is the critical issue—if the larger rat does not let the smaller rat win the\\nrepeated wrestling matches some substantial proportion of the time (Panksepp estimated\\n30 to 40 percent of the time), the smaller rat will stop exhibiting invitations to play. It is just\\nnot any fun for the little guy. Thus, if the larger rat dominates with power (like a bully), as\\nhe could, then he will lose at the highest level (the level where the fun continues for the\\nlongest possible time), even while he “wins” more frequently at the lower. What does this\\nimply? Most important, that power is simply not a stable basis upon which to construct a\\nhierarchy designed to optimally govern repeated interactions. And this is not just true for\\nrats. Alpha males among at least certain primate groups are far more prosocial than their\\nlesser comrades. Power doesn’t work for them, either (see F. B. M. de Waal and M. Suchak,\\n“Prosocial Primates: Selfish and Unselfish Motivations,” Philosophical Transactions of the\\nRoyal Society of London: Biological Science 365 [2010]: 2711–22. See also F. de Waal, The\\nSurprising Science of Alpha Males, TEDMED 2017, bit.ly/primate_ethic).\\n\\n\\x0c*This makes the July 30, 2019, poll from YouGov, “Millennials Are the Loneliest\\nGeneration” (bit.ly/2TVVMLn), indicating that 25 percent have no acquaintances and 22\\npercent no friends, particularly ominous, if true.\\n\\n\\x0c*This is part of the Self-Authoring Suite, a set of individual programs designed to help\\npeople write about the troubles of their past (Past Authoring), the faults and virtues of their\\npresent personality (Present Authoring, in two parts), and their desires and wishes for the\\nfuture (Future Authoring). I specifically recommended the latter.\\n\\n\\x0c*You can see this played out, for example, in the proclivity of American evangelical\\nProtestants to ask, when faced with a novel existential problem, “What would Jesus do?” It\\nis an easy approach to parody, but indicates precisely the values of stories: Once a narrative\\nhas been internalized, it can be used as a template to generate new perceptions and\\nbehaviors. It might seem naive or presumptuous to imagine what actions the archetypal\\nSavior Himself might undertake in the confines of a normal life, but the fundamental\\npurpose of religious narratives is in fact to motivate imitation.\\n\\n\\x0c*All biblical citations are from the King James Version unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\x0c*A codex is a book composed of sheets of vellum, papyrus, or most commonly, paper. The\\nterm is now generally reserved for manuscripts that have been handwritten, as in the case of\\nthe Codex Bezae. The Codex Bezae contains Greek and Latin versions of Acts and most of\\nthe four Gospels that are unique in what they additionally include, what they omit, and\\noften, the style in which they are written.\\n\\n\\x0c*And don’t think the game can’t be played (isn’t played) in the opposite manner. The same\\napplies for femininity, for example, in too many places in the world: in Arabic, for example,\\nthe word awrah denotes the body’s intimate parts, which must be clothed. The term’s root\\nawr means something approximating “weakness,” “imperfection,” or “defectiveness.”\\n“Nakedness” is the most common English translation. Other meanings include “falseness,”\\n“artificiality,” or “blindness.” According to the dictionary compiled by Mohammad Moin, a\\nwell-known Iranian scholar of Persian literature and Iranian studies, awrah means both\\n“nakedness” or “shame” and “young woman.” In keeping with this network of ideas, the\\nword awrat, derived from awrah, has been used widely in various Arabic-influenced\\ncultures to signify “woman.” It is for such reasons that women are viewed by those who\\nfollow the Wahhabi strand of Islam, for example—ultraconservative, austere, and\\npuritanical—as sufficiently responsible for the evil and temptation of the world that their\\nmovements must be drastically and severely restricted, even that they are not allowed to\\nshow themselves in any important manner in the public sphere.\\n\\n\\x0c*The illness that had destroyed Mikhaila’s ankle, necessitating its replacement, as well as\\nher hip, was also immune related, and my wife had some arthritic symptoms that were\\nsimilar to hers. I am mentioning this to shed some light on why the assumption of an\\nimmune response program sprang to mind and made a certain sense.\\n\\n\\x0c*I had taken serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Celexa for nearly two decades, greatly\\nbenefiting from their administration, before stopping in early 2016, because a dramatic\\ndietary change seemed to render them unnecessary.\\n\\n\\x0c*It may be of some interest to note that this book and its predecessor—although each stands\\non its own—were also designed jointly to represent the balance they both strive to describe.\\nIt is for this reason that (in the English-language versions, at least) the first is bound in\\nwhite and the second in black. They constitute a matched set, like the Taoist yin and yang.\\n\\n\\x0c*My YouTube channel can be found at www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos. My\\npodcast and blog can be accessed at jordanbpeterson.com.\\n\\n\\x0c*A word of advice for anyone seeking mental health help in a large city clinic, where the\\npsychiatrist seeing you might take fifteen minutes to assess your life and determine the\\nnature of your illness: do not casually mention any odd experiences or beliefs. You may well\\nlive to regret it. It takes very little to accrue a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the conditions\\nthat prevail in an overloaded mental health system—and once the diagnosis has been\\nestablished, it is very hard to shake. It is difficult, personally, not to take a medical\\ndescription seriously. It is harder than you might think to disbelieve a qualified psychiatrist\\n(who should, after all, know what he or she is talking about), particularly if you are\\nexperiencing strange symptoms. It is difficult practically, as well, because once such a\\ndiagnosis becomes part of your permanent medical record, it is very difficult to have it\\nmodified. Anything out of the ordinary about you will, from then on, attract undue attention\\n(even from yourself), and any displays of normality will be downplayed. Now, I say all that\\nknowing full well that some people who have odd beliefs are in fact schizophrenic—but a fair\\nbit of digging is usually in order to establish that diagnosis, and busy psychiatrists in public\\nhospitals seldom have the time for careful excavation.\\n\\n\\x0c*The Past Authoring Program at www.selfauthoring.com. Dr. James W. Pennebaker of the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, and a host of colleagues working directly with him and\\nindependently, have demonstrated that writing that reduces existential uncertainty (there’s\\nno simpler general way of putting it) reduces anxiety, improves mental health, and boosts\\nimmunological function. All of these effects appear associated with a general decrease in\\ncomplexity-induced stress and the hormones—harmful in excess—consequentially\\nproduced. Pennebaker demonstrated, for example, that students who wrote for three days,\\nconsecutively, about the worst events in their lives experienced, first, a decline in mood (no\\ndoubt elicited by calling forth such memories) but significant improvement in their lot over\\nthe period of the following months. Other researchers showed similar effects when students\\nwrote about their future. Pennebaker initially assumed that it was something akin to\\nemotional expression, or catharsis (following Freud), that produced these positive effects—\\nthe opportunity to express anger or regret or sorrow—but found, as the result of a careful\\nsemantic analysis, that it was the development of a cognitive and causal understanding of\\nthe reason for the events and their significance that was curative. The effects of writing\\nabout the future seemed similar, in that the plans thereby generated reduced uncertainty\\nand put forward a simpler and more well-defined structure around what might otherwise\\nhave been the intolerably unspecified looming weeks and months ahead. For a review, see J.\\nW. Pennebaker and J. F. Evans, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal (Enumclaw, Wash.:\\nIdyll Arbor Inc., 2014).\\n\\n\\x0c*Responsibility, stewardship, service; not from physical strength (Cambridge Bible for\\nSchools and Colleges); the power of governing and controlling; but most important, the\\nsame dominion as God has over or for man.\\n\\n\\x0c*Perhaps it is for this reason that Christ insists “it is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your\\nGod to the test.’” (In this instance I prefer Matthew 4:7 of the New International Version to\\nthe same verse in the King James Version.)\\n\\n\\x0c*Consider the professional impersonator. He or she doesn’t necessarily copy the precise\\nbehaviors, movement for movement, of those being impersonated, but the spirit—what’s\\ncommon across all the behaviors of the target celebrity. The same is true when children play\\nat being adults. It’s the spirit they’re after, not the individual behaviors.\\n\\n\\x0c*Alchemy—the search for the philosopher’s stone, an artifact that would transform base\\nmetals into gold, as well as rewarding its bearer with health and immortality—was practiced\\nfor thousands of years by the misfits, mystics, magicians, and prescientific practitioners who\\ntook the first fantastical steps toward establishing what eventually became genuine science.\\nAs alchemy developed, however, the “stone” eventually became conceptualized as something\\nmore akin to a personality than a material object, as the alchemists increasingly realized\\nthat the development of the psyche was a more important pursuit than mere gold itself. I\\nwrote about this in J. B. Peterson, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (New York:\\nRoutledge, 1999), which contains the relevant references to the work on alchemy conducted\\nby Jung and his students.\\n\\n\\x0c*We’re going to approach the picture from the very bottom upward, as if each element were\\nemerging from the lower. Images of this type (and they are a type) often represent a process\\nof psychological or spiritual development or growth, and appear to employ the basic\\nsymbolism of a plant or a tree extending itself upward as it matures. Something similar can\\nbe observed in Eastern images of the Buddha, emerging from a lotus flower floating on the\\nsurface of placid water, with its stalk extending into the murky deep underneath and its\\nroots grounded far, far below even that, into the mud that composes the lowest level of the\\ndepths.\\n\\n\\x0c*As gold is both rare and unwilling, so to speak, to combine promiscuously with other\\nelements or compounds.\\n\\n\\x0c*It is of some real interest to note—particularly in relationship to the discussion of the\\ndangers of creativity presented in Rule I—that the Seekers chase the Snitch both inside and\\noutside the playing field that provides boundaries for all the other players. While outside,\\nthey can careen through the wooden foundation of the Quidditch stadium. This would not\\nbe a problem, if they weren’t simultaneously being chased by a Bludger, a solid, massive,\\nflying ball capable not only of knocking them off their brooms, but of crashing through and\\nseriously damaging that same structure. If they succeed in catching the Snitch, as we have\\nindicated, they generally attain victory. But they risk damaging the very foundations of the\\ngame while doing so—just as creative people do when they pursue their innovative yet\\ndisruptive visions.\\n\\n\\x0c*It is also of great interest to note, in this regard, that the metal mercury can be used in the\\nmining and purification of gold. Gold dissolves in mercury, and mercury can, therefore, be\\nused to draw out the small amounts of the precious metal typically found in ores. The\\nmercury is then boiled off (it has a low boiling point) so that only the gold remains. The\\nproclivity of mercury for gold has given rise to the symbolic idea that the liquid metal has an\\n“affinity” for what is most precious: that mercury will seek what is noble and pure and\\nincorruptible—like gold itself, speaking symbolically once again—and concentrate it in\\nusable amounts. So, the fundamental idea is that the pursuit of meaning, guided by\\nMercury, messenger of the gods (the unconscious, as far as modern people are concerned),\\nwill enable the Seeker to collect what is, like gold, of the highest value. For the alchemists\\nwho created drawings like the one we are analyzing, that highest value came to be the\\nultimate development of the psyche, or spirit, or personality.\\n\\n\\x0c*This is part of the reason science developed so long after religion and ritual—so incredibly\\nrecently, and by no means everywhere at once.\\n\\n\\x0c*Furthermore, in the mythological world, unlike the objective, logical world, things can be\\none thing and their opposite at the same time. And this representation in the mythological\\nworld is more accurate than the objective, in the experiential manner described previously:\\nNature, for example, is Creator and Destroyer, just as Culture is Protector and Tyrant. It\\nmight be objected: Nature and Culture are not singular things. They can be differentiated, so\\nthat their paradoxical components are separated, understood, and dealt with. This is all\\ntrue: but the paradoxical components are often experienced simultaneously and so unified.\\nThis occurs when anyone is betrayed, for example, in a love affair. Beast and man, Medusa\\nand beloved woman are often united experientially in the same hypothetically unitary\\nfigure. This can be a terrible discovery when made in real life.\\n\\n\\x0c*The same idea is expressed in Taoist cosmogony, when the yin and the yang differentiate\\nthemselves into the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The ancient Greeks\\nbelieved, similarly, that Earth and Sky (Gaia and Uranus) gave birth to the Titans, elemental\\ndeities of great strength and power.\\n\\n\\x0c*E pluribus unum.\\n\\n\\x0c*Ea makes man from the blood of Kingu, the most terrible of Tiamat’s monsters. A bright\\ngraduate student and later colleague of mine once suggested that this was because of all\\nGod’s creatures, only man could deceive; only man could voluntarily bring evil and discord\\ninto the world.\\n\\n\\x0c*It has been known for decades, explicitly (and forever, implicitly) that self-initiated\\nconfrontation with what is frightening or unknown is frequently curative. The standard\\ntreatment for phobias and anxiety is therefore exposure to what is feared. That treatment is\\neffective—but the exposure must be voluntary. It is as if the anxiety systems of the brain\\nassume that anything that is advanced upon must not be a predator (or, if it is a predator, it\\nis the sort that can be easily kicked to the side and defeated). We now know that even the\\nemotional and bodily response to stress differs completely when that stress is voluntarily\\nfaced rather than accidentally encountered. In the latter case, the threatened individual\\ntenses up and readies him or herself defensively (see M. D. Seery, “Challenge or Threat?\\nCardiovascular Indexes of Resilience and Vulnerability to Potential Stress in Humans,”\\nNeuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews 35 [2011]: 1603–4). That can become the\\nchronically unhealthy posture of someone turned to stone. In the former case, the individual\\ntakes on the role of probable victor, and advances forthrightly. Such actions are indeed what\\nhas always saved humanity from the terrors of the night (and the evil lurking in the human\\nheart). Our continual observation of that fact, over millennia, is what allowed us to\\nrepresent it, abstractly, in our great religious stories, and then to imitate it, within the\\nconfines of our particular and unique life.\\n\\n\\x0c*This is at least in part because you are very unlikely to have already looked there, even\\nthough it would have been useful to do so.\\n\\n\\x0c*Something must be further clarified here. I made the case in the Overture, in Rule I, in 12\\nRules for Life, and in Maps of Meaning that chaos tends to find its representation in\\nsymbolic form as feminine—but here I am talking about chaos, in serpentine guise. I can\\nexplain this by elaborating on my explanation about the alchemical picture we discussed\\nearlier—by reading it from the top down, however, this time. The more profound the threat\\n—the deeper the chaos—the more likely that it will represent itself as mankind’s most\\nancient enemy, the serpent. Perhaps it can be thought of like this: the unknown unknowns—\\nthose elements of being that are foreign and dangerous beyond imagination, and whose\\nmanifestation can kill or destroy psychologically—are those most likely to be represented in\\nserpentine form. Out of this domain, which is in some important sense even more\\nfundamental than sex itself, emerges the primordial feminine and masculine, although it\\nseems that the feminine nonetheless retains a more primary connection with the\\nfundamental unknowable itself. I think this has to do primarily with the absolute mystery of\\nbirth: with the relationship between the emergence of new forms from the feminine and the\\nemergence of new forms from the absolutely unknown. It is perhaps something of this sort\\nthat accounts for the primacy of the relationship between the snake in the Garden of Eden\\nand Eve, rather than between the snake and Adam. Perhaps, as well (and I am speculating\\nwildly here, trying to move beyond my ignorance, trying to account for the clear and\\nomnipresent symbolic relationship), it has forever been the case that females attract snakes\\n(as well as other dangerous predators), most particularly when they are taking care of their\\nyoung, and that the heightened danger they therefore face has burned the danger of the\\nfeminine in relationship to the serpentine forever in our imagination. This would imply that\\nthe decision to take on a relationship with a female brings with it increased exposure to the\\nterrible unknown (something that seems clearly true in the case of all the threats that are\\nfaced by children), as perhaps does the fact of being female itself. Now the female is also a\\nrejecting force (particularly among humans, where the females are very choosy maters [see,\\nfor example, Y. Bokek-Cohen, Y. Peres, and S. Kanazawa, “Rational Choice and Evolutionary\\nPsychology as Explanations for Mate Selectivity,” Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and\\nCultural Psychology 2 (2008): 42–55]). That holding of the power of ultimate rejection\\nmakes Nature in all its cruelty (and, it must be said, wisdom). Perhaps that is also a\\nnontrivial contributor to the feminine-serpent relationship.\\n\\n\\x0c*The motto of the British Special Air Service.\\n\\n\\x0c*I have obtained direct express permission from my client to communicate all this\\ninformation in this manner.\\n\\n\\x0c*Perhaps not just once, because that makes your reaction too impulsive; perhaps not just\\ntwice, because that still may not constitute sufficient evidence to risk undertaking what\\nmight be a genuine war; but definitively three times, when a pattern has been clearly\\nestablished.\\n\\n\\x0c*The same idea emerged constantly in the centuries of alchemical literature, which tended\\noverwhelmingly to represent the perfect person (the possessor, in a spiritual or\\npsychological sense, of the philosopher’s stone) as a consequence of the mystical marriage\\nbetween the feminine and masculine elements of the psyche. We discussed this in some\\ndetail in Rule II: Imagine who you could be and aim single-mindedly at that, with regard to\\nthe figure of the Rebis.\\n\\n\\x0c*Peter Pan, Act III, gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300081h.html.\\n\\n\\x0c*Peter Pan, Act V, scene 2 (closing paragraph),\\ngutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300081h.html.\\n\\n\\x0c*I provided an extensive analysis in my first book, Maps of Meaning, as well as mentioning\\nit in 12 Rules for Life, Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient).\\n\\n\\x0c*So that’s 1,000 pictures of paintings x 300 days per year x 4 = 1,200,000 paintings. That\\nhas to be some sort of record (not that it matters, but it’s comical to consider), mostly\\nbecause I do not think it would have been possible to see that many paintings before\\ninternet technology made massive databases possible.\\n\\n\\x0c'\n"

      "the Pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a perplexing task to produce a nonfiction book during the global\n",
      "crisis brought about by the spread of COVID-19. It seems absurd, in\n",
      "some sense, even to think about anything else but that illness during\n",
      "this trying time. Nonetheless, binding all the thoughts contained in\n",
      "any current work to the existence of the pandemic—which too shall\n",
      "pass—seems like an error, as the normal problems of life will return\n",
      "at some point (and thankfully) to the forefront. That all means that\n",
      "an author of the present day is inevitably going to make one mistake\n",
      "(concentrating too much on the pandemic, which has an uncertain\n",
      "life span, and producing a book that is instantly dated, in\n",
      "consequence) or another (ignoring the pandemic, which is very much\n",
      "like failing to attend to the proverbial elephant under the rug).\n",
      "\n",
      "After considering this, as well as discussing the issues with my\n",
      "publishers, I decided to write Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life\n",
      "according to the plan laid out for it several years ago, and to\n",
      "concentrate on addressing issues not specific to the current time\n",
      "(thus, to risk the second error rather than the first). I suppose it may\n",
      "also be the case that those who have chosen to read this book or\n",
      "listen to the audio version might be relieved to turn their attention to\n",
      "something other than the coronavirus and the devastation it has\n",
      "wrought.\n",

      "\fOverture\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fifth of February 2020, I awoke in an intensive care ward in,\n",
      "of all places, Moscow. I had six-inch tethers attaching me to the sides\n",
      "of the bed because, in my unconscious state, I had been agitated\n",
      "enough to try to remove the catheters from my arm and leave the\n",
      "ICU. I was confused and frustrated not knowing where I was,\n",
      "surrounded by people speaking a foreign language, and in the\n",
      "absence of my daughter, Mikhaila, and her husband, Andrey, who\n",
      "were restricted to short visiting hours and did not have permission to\n",
      "be there with me at my moment of wakening. I was angry, too, about\n",
      "being there, and lunged at my daughter when she did visit several\n",
      "hours later. I felt betrayed, although that was the furthest from the\n",
      "truth. People had been attending to my various needs with great\n",
      "diligence, and in the wake of the tremendous logistic challenges that\n",
      "come about from seeking medical care in a truly foreign country. I do\n",
      "not have any memory of anything that happened to me during the\n",
      "most recent weeks preceding that, and very little between that\n",
      "moment and my having entered a hospital in Toronto, in mid-\n",
      "December. One of the few things I could recall, looking back to the\n",
      "earliest days of the year, was the time I had spent writing this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wrote much and edited almost all of Beyond Order during a time\n",
      "when my family was plagued by sequential and overlapping bouts of\n",
      "seriously impaired health, much of which was the subject of public\n",
      "discussion, and for that reason requires some detailed explanation.\n",
      "First, in January 2019, Mikhaila had to seek out a surgeon to replace\n",
      "much of her artificial ankle, implanted about a decade earlier, as the\n",
      "initial installation was never perfect, causing her serious pain and\n",
      "trouble with movement as a consequence, and then came near to\n",
      "failing. I spent a week with her at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland,\n",
      "for the week of that procedure and her initial recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fAt the beginning of March, my wife, Tammy, underwent routine\n",
      "\n",
      "surgery in Toronto for a common and eminently treatable kidney\n",
      "cancer. A month and a half after that surgery, which involved the\n",
      "removal of one third of the organ in question, we learned that she\n",
      "was actually suffering from an extremely rare malignancy, which had\n",
      "a one-year fatality rate of close to 100 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks later, the surgeons involved in her care removed the\n",
      "remaining two thirds of her afflicted kidney, along with a substantial\n",
      "proportion of the related abdominal lymphatic system. The surgery\n",
      "appeared to bring the progression of the cancer to a halt, but\n",
      "produced leakage of fluid (up to four liters, or one gallon, a day) from\n",
      "her now-damaged lymphatic system—a condition known as chylous\n",
      "ascites—which rivaled the original condition in danger. We\n",
      "journeyed to see a medical team in Philadelphia, where within\n",
      "ninety-six hours of the initial injection of a poppy seed oil dye, whose\n",
      "practical purpose was the enhancement of images derived from CAT\n",
      "or MRI scans, the complete cessation of Tammy’s fluid loss was\n",
      "achieved. This breakthrough occurred on the very day of our thirtieth\n",
      "wedding anniversary. She recovered rapidly and, to all appearances,\n",
      "completely—a testament to the luck without which none of us can\n",
      "live, and to her own admirable strength and resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, while these events unfolded, my health fell apart. I\n",
      "had begun to take an antianxiety agent at the beginning of 2017, after\n",
      "suffering from what appeared to be an autoimmune reaction to\n",
      "something I had consumed during the Christmas holiday period of\n",
      "2016.* The food reaction made me acutely and continually anxious,\n",
      "as well as freezing cold, no matter what clothes I was wearing or how\n",
      "many blankets I layered upon myself. Further, it lowered my blood\n",
      "pressure so dramatically that whenever I tried to stand I would gray\n",
      "out and be forced into a crouch half a dozen or more times before\n",
      "trying again. I also experienced insomnia that appeared near total.\n",
      "My family physician prescribed a benzodiazepine as well as a drug\n",
      "for sleeping. I took the latter a mere handful of times before ceasing\n",
      "its use entirely; the terrible symptoms I was experiencing, including\n",
      "the insomnia, were almost immediately and entirely eradicated by\n",
      "the benzodiazepine treatment, making the sleep agent unnecessary. I\n",
      "continued the benzodiazepine for almost exactly three years, because\n",
      "my life did seem unnaturally stressful during that time (the period\n",
      "when my life changed from the quiet existence of a university\n",
      "\n",
      "\fprofessor and clinician to the tumultuous reality of a public figure),\n",
      "and because I believed that this drug was—as is often claimed of\n",
      "benzodiazepines—a relatively harmless substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things changed, however, in March 2019, at the onset of my wife’s\n",
      "\n",
      "medical battle. My anxiety spiked noticeably after Mikhaila’s\n",
      "aforementioned hospitalization, surgery, and recovery. In\n",
      "consequence, I asked my family physician to increase my dose of\n",
      "benzodiazepine, so that I would not be preoccupied by nor preoccupy\n",
      "others with my anxiety. Unfortunately, I experienced a marked\n",
      "increase in negative emotion following the adjustment. I asked to\n",
      "have the dosage raised yet again (by this time, we were attempting to\n",
      "deal with the second of Tammy’s surgeries and its complications, and\n",
      "I attributed my even more severe anxiety to that problem), but my\n",
      "anxiety increased even further. I attributed all of this not to a\n",
      "paradoxical reaction to the medication (which it was later diagnosed\n",
      "as), but to the recurrence of a tendency toward depression that had\n",
      "plagued me for years.* In any case, I ceased using the\n",
      "benzodiazepine entirely in May of that year, trying two doses of\n",
      "ketamine within a week, as suggested by a psychiatrist with whom I\n",
      "consulted. Ketamine, a nonstandard anesthetic/psychedelic,\n",
      "sometimes has overwhelming and sudden positive effects on\n",
      "depression. It produced nothing for me but two ninety-minute trips\n",
      "to hell. I felt to my bones as if I had everything to feel guilty and\n",
      "ashamed about, with nothing gained by my positive experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days after the second ketamine experience, I began to suffer\n",
      "\n",
      "the effects of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal, which were truly\n",
      "intolerable—anxiety far beyond what I had ever experienced, an\n",
      "uncontrollable restlessness and need to move (formally known as\n",
      "akathisia), overwhelming thoughts of self-destruction, and the\n",
      "complete absence of any happiness whatsoever. A family friend—a\n",
      "physician—enlightened me as to the dangers of sudden\n",
      "benzodiazepine withdrawal. I therefore started to take a\n",
      "benzodiazepine once again—but a smaller dose than I had climbed to\n",
      "previously. Many, but not all, of my symptoms abated. To deal with\n",
      "those that remained, I also began to take an antidepressant that had\n",
      "been of great use to me in the past. All it did, however, was make me\n",
      "exhausted enough to require an additional four or more hours of\n",
      "sleep a day—which was not helpful in the midst of Tammy’s serious\n",
      "health issues—as well as increase my appetite two- or threefold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fAfter about three months of terrible anxiety, uncontrollable\n",
      "\n",
      "hypersomnia, viciously torturous akathisia, and excessive appetite, I\n",
      "traveled to an American clinic that claimed to specialize in rapid\n",
      "benzodiazepine withdrawal. Despite the good intentions of many of\n",
      "its psychiatrists, the clinic managed only a slow cessation or tapering\n",
      "of my benzodiazepine dosage, the negative effects of which I was\n",
      "already experiencing and which were not and could not be controlled\n",
      "to any significant degree whatsoever by the inpatient treatment\n",
      "offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I resided at that clinic, nonetheless, from mid-August, a mere few\n",
      "\n",
      "days after Tammy had recovered from her postsurgical\n",
      "complications, to late November, when I returned home to Toronto,\n",
      "much the worse for wear. By this time, the akathisia (the disorder of\n",
      "uncontrollable movement alluded to earlier) had increased to the\n",
      "point where I could not sit or rest in any position for any length of\n",
      "time whatsoever without severe distress. In December I checked in to\n",
      "a local hospital, and it was at that point that my awareness of events\n",
      "prior to my awakening in Moscow ends. As I later learned, Mikhaila\n",
      "and Andrey removed me from the Toronto hospital in early January\n",
      "2020, believing that the treatment I received there was doing me\n",
      "more harm than good (an opinion I concurred with entirely once I\n",
      "learned of it).\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation I found myself in upon reattaining consciousness in\n",
      "Russia was complicated by the fact that I had also developed double\n",
      "pneumonia in Canada, although that was neither discovered nor\n",
      "treated until I was in the Moscow ICU. However, I was there\n",
      "primarily so that the clinic could facilitate my withdrawal from\n",
      "benzodiazepines, using a procedure either unknown or regarded as\n",
      "too dangerous in North America. Since I had not been able to\n",
      "tolerate any decrease in dosage whatsoever—apart from the initial\n",
      "reduction, months before—the clinic placed me in a medically\n",
      "induced coma so that I might remain unconscious during the very\n",
      "worst withdrawal symptoms. That regimen started January 5 and\n",
      "lasted nine days, during which I was also placed in a machine so that\n",
      "my breathing was mechanically regulated. On January 14, I was\n",
      "taken off the anesthetic and the intubation. I woke up for a few\n",
      "hours, and indicated during this time to Mikhaila that I was no\n",
      "longer suffering from akathisia, although I remember nothing of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fOn January 23, I was moved to another ICU specializing in\n",
      "neurological rehabilitation. I can recall waking up on the twenty-\n",
      "sixth for a short period, until my more complete return to\n",
      "consciousness, as previously related, on February 5—ten days during\n",
      "which I passed through a period of delirium of vivid intensity. Once\n",
      "that cleared, I moved to a more homelike rehabilitation center in the\n",
      "outer suburbs of Moscow. While there, I had to relearn how to walk\n",
      "and up and down stairs, button my clothes, lie down in bed on my\n",
      "own, place my hands in the proper position on a computer keyboard,\n",
      "and type. I did not seem to be able to see properly—or, more\n",
      "accurately, see how to use my limbs to interact with what I perceived.\n",
      "A few weeks later, after the problems in perception and coordination\n",
      "had essentially abated, Mikhaila, Andrey, their child, and I relocated\n",
      "to Florida for what we hoped would be some peaceful time of\n",
      "recuperation in the sun (very much welcome after the cold grayness\n",
      "of midwinter Moscow). This was immediately before worldwide\n",
      "concern erupted over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Florida, I attempted to wean off the medication prescribed by\n",
      "the Moscow clinic, although I was still experiencing numbness in my\n",

      "these questions (although both answers relate importantly to each\n",
      "other):\n",
      "\n",
      "First: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any\n",
      "\n",
      "game is the person who plays fair. This is because playing fair,\n",
      "\n",
      "\fdespite the particularities of any given game, is a higher-order\n",
      "accomplishment than mere victory. Striving to play fair, in the\n",
      "ultimate sense—following the spirit of the rules, as well as the letter—\n",
      "is an indication of true personality development, predicated as it is\n",
      "on concern for true reciprocity. The Seekers of the Snitch must\n",
      "ignore the details of the game of Quidditch, of which they are still a\n",
      "part, while attempting to find and seize the Snitch, just as the player\n",
      "of a real-world game must ignore the particularities of that game\n",
      "while attending to what constitutes truly ethical play, regardless of\n",
      "what is happening on the playing field. Thus, the ethical player, like\n",
      "the Seeker, indomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst\n",
      "of complex, competing obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated\n",
      "with the winged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the\n",
      "realm of the divine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of\n",
      "good fortune. It is for this reason that the ancient symbol for\n",
      "Mercury is located at the very pinnacle (the most important location)\n",
      "of the image in question. It is an attempt to indicate what guides the\n",
      "process that the picture represents. Centuries ago, prior to the dawn\n",

      "attracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit who possessed a\n",
      "person when his or her attention was drawn irresistibly to some\n",
      "person, situation, or event. Imagine that there are very complex\n",
      "processes going on in your mind unconsciously, highlighting events\n",
      "of potential worth and distinguishing them from everything else\n",
      "constantly unfolding around you. Imagine that those processes that\n",
      "distinguish value are alive, which is certainly the case, and that they\n",
      "are complex and integrated enough to be conceptualized as a\n",

      "reveals itself in a sense of significance—in the sense that something\n",
      "happening around you is worth attending to, or contains something\n",
      "of value. The Seeker—in real life, as well as in Rowling’s Potter series\n",
      "and its Quidditch game—is he or she who takes that sense of\n",

      "paint nude women”), and projection (“I am not touchy; you are just\n",
      "annoying”). Freud was an outstanding philosopher of deceit. He was\n",
      "not afraid to point out the relationship between dishonesty and\n",
      "psychopathology. Nonetheless, his ideas of self-deception suffer, in\n",
      "my opinion, from two major errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "First error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission contributed\n",
      "\n",
      "to mental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of commission,\n",
      "listed above, that constitute repression. In doing so, he merely\n",
      "thought in the typical manner. People generally believe that actively\n",
      "doing something bad (that is the sin of commission) is, on average,\n",
      "worse than passively not doing something good (that is the sin of\n",
      "omission). Perhaps this is because there are always good things we\n",
      "are not doing; some sins of omission are therefore inevitable. In any\n",
      "case, there are still times when willful blindness nonetheless\n",
      "produces more serious catastrophes, more easily rationalized away,\n",
      "than the active or the unconscious repression of something terrible\n",
      "but understood (the latter being a sin of commission, because it is\n",
      "known). The former problem—willful blindness—occurs when you\n",
      "could come to know something but cease exploring so that you fail to\n",
      "discover something that might cause you substantial discomfort.\n",
      "Spin doctors call this self-imposed ignorance “plausible deniability,”\n",
      "which is a phrase that indicates intellectualized rationalization of the\n",
      "most pathological order. It should be noted that such blindness is\n",
      "often regarded as an outright crime. If you are a CEO, for example,\n",
      "and you suspect that your treasurer is cooking the books, and you do\n",
      "not investigate because you do not want to know, you may still be\n",
      "liable for your inaction—as is appropriate. Failing to look under the\n",
      "bed when you strongly suspect a monster is lurking there is not an\n",
      "advisable strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second error: Freud assumed that things experienced are things\n",
      "understood. In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a\n",
      "memory trace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately\n",
      "represented the past, like an objective video recording. These would\n",
      "\n",
      "\fbe reasonable presumptions, if our experience was simply a series of\n",
      "objectively real and self-evident events transmitted through our\n",
      "senses, thought about, evaluated, and then acted upon. If this was all\n",
      "true, traumatic experience would be accurately represented in\n",
      "memory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious\n",
      "mechanisms (or conscious—but Freud presumed the former)\n",
      "because of its understood but terrible nature. However, neither\n",
      "reality nor our processing of reality is as objective or articulated as\n",
      "Freud presupposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine, for example, that you have been ignored, romantically—\n",
      "\n",
      "more than you can tolerate—for several months by your wife or\n",
      "husband. Then you encounter him or her leaning over the fence,\n",
      "talking in a friendly manner (and perhaps no more than that) to an\n",
      "attractive neighbor. How we process such anomalous, novel,\n",

      "is by no means self-evident. Upon witnessing your spouse talking to\n",
      "the neighbor, therefore, it is not as if you think, in an altogether\n",

      "when I have experienced so little attention.” It is much more likely\n",

      "In consequence, you have become sensitized to any signs of rejection,\n",
      "even imaginary, within your marriage. So, what you must determine\n",
      "is not so much why your wife or husband is no longer attentive to\n",

      "Perhaps you really are being ignored, just as you suspect. Perhaps it\n",
      "is a sign of an impending affair and a manifestation of the trajectory\n",
      "that leads to divorce. Both of those, if true, are serious problems. It is\n",
      "no wonder you are upset. But you may remain stubbornly unwilling\n",
      "to consider that your career or marriage is in trouble. And that is no\n",

      "\n",
      "On top of all that is the general complexity of life, complicating the\n",
      "\n",
      "search for clarity. Consider the question “What really happened?”\n",
      "say, in a failed marriage, divorce, and child-custody battle. The\n",

      "frequently requires court evaluation and multi-party assessment.\n",
      "Even then, one or even both of the protagonists is unlikely to believe\n",
      "that the truth has been served. This is partly because events in\n",
      "general and interpersonal events specifically do not exist as simple,\n",
      "objective facts, independent of one another. Everything depends for\n",
      "its meaning—for the information it truly represents—on the context\n",

      "mystery, and his remembrance was of a slower, more surprising, and\n",
      "unlikelier sort. He was a young, gay African American man who was\n",
      "suffering from a set of incomprehensible mental and physical\n",
      "symptoms. A psychiatrist had recently diagnosed him with\n",
      "schizophrenia, but his aunt, who had taken him to the hospital for\n",
      "evaluation, believed that insufficient time had been spent on her\n",
      "nephew’s evaluation. She contacted me for a second opinion and\n",
      "brought him to my office. I saw him alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was shy and reserved, but neatly and carefully dressed, and\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared fully oriented when I started to gather his history.\n",
      "Furthermore, he wore eyeglasses—and they were well taken care of,\n",
      "lacking tape on the bridge or arms, and with lenses that were\n",
      "perfectly clean. These observations were all relevant, as far as I was\n",
      "concerned. Schizophrenics lose the ability to monitor themselves\n",
      "effectively, so unkempt clothing and damaged eyeglasses—\n",
      "particularly with badly smudged lenses—are telling features (not\n",
      "invariably: so those of you with subpar eyewear are not required to\n",
      "consider yourself classified). In any case, he also had a full-time job\n",
      "of reasonable complexity (another rarity for someone with\n",
      "schizophrenia), and he could carry on a conversation with no\n",
      "problem, apart from his tendency toward shyness. I accepted him as\n",
      "a client, and we began to meet regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to see him a few times before I could determine why the\n",
      "psychiatrist had diagnosed him with such a serious disorder. He\n",
      "began by telling me that for the last four years he had been depressed\n",
      "and anxious. There was nothing markedly uncommon in that. His\n",
      "symptoms followed on the heels of a serious fight with his boyfriend\n",
      "and the permanent cessation of their relationship, which had lasted\n",
      "several years. Nothing in that was unusual, either. The two had been\n",
      "living together. Their partnership was important to him, emotionally\n",
      "and practically—and the dissolution of an intimate relationship\n",
      "produces unhappiness and confusion in most everyone, and can\n",
      "trigger more severe and lasting anxiety and depression in people who\n",
      "are so predisposed. The duration was out of the ordinary, however.\n",
      "People typically pick up the pieces and move on in under a year. That\n",
      "\n",
      "\fis not a hard-and-fast rule, but four years is a long time. That piqued\n",
      "my curiosity. He also revealed something else very much out of the\n",
      "ordinary. He told me that he experienced strange, convulsive bodily\n",
      "movements—every night—while attempting to sleep. His body would\n",
      "contort into a fetal position, and his arms would cross over his face.\n",
      "Then he would relax, only to find himself repeating the movements.\n",
      "So it went, for hours. Apart from being concerning because of its\n",
      "incomprehensibility, it was interfering badly with his sleep. This had\n",
      "been going on for about the same amount of time as the anxiety and\n",
      "depression, and the poor sleep, if not the movements themselves,\n",
      "was certainly a contributing factor. I asked him what he thought was\n",
      "happening. He said, with a laugh, “My family thinks I am possessed,\n",
      "and I am not sure they are wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My client’s familial background was somewhat unusual. His\n",
      "parents, immigrants to Canada from the southern United States,\n",
      "were uneducated to a marked degree, very superstitious and\n",
      "religious, and apparently serious in the belief that spirits inhabited\n",
      "their son. I asked him, “Did you by chance tell the psychiatrist about\n",
      "being possessed?” He said, “Yes.” I thought, “Well, that explains why\n",
      "he diagnosed you with schizophrenia.” That explanation, in tandem\n",
      "with the strange physical symptoms, would have been sufficient, in\n",
      "my experience.* However, after meeting with this man for several\n",
      "sessions, it was clear to me that whatever was plaguing him was not\n",
      "schizophrenia. He was perfectly rational and lucid. But what in the\n",
      "world could be causing these strange, nightly, seizure-like\n",
      "convulsions? I had never encountered anything of the sort. My first\n",
      "hypothesis was that he suffered from a very severe form of sleep\n",
      "paralysis. This is a reasonably common condition. It generally occurs\n",
      "when people are sleeping on their backs (which he tended to do). A\n",
      "person with sleep paralysis semi-awakens, but not enough to stop\n",
      "dreaming, nor to escape from the inability to move that characterizes\n",
      "the rapid-eye-movement (REM) phase of sleeping. When you are\n",
      "dreaming, the same brain areas that govern active movement when\n",
      "you are awake are often stimulated (you experience this as the sense\n",
      "of moving while in your dream). You do not move around in sync\n",
      "with that brain activation because your voluntary musculature is\n",
      "switched off, physiologically, by a specialized neurochemical\n",
      "mechanism that has exactly that function.2 Otherwise you would get\n",
      "\n",

      "quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a sleep paralysis episode, the sufferer wakes up enough to\n",
      "\n",
      "be semi-aware of the real world, but is still in REM paralysis and\n",
      "dreaming. All sorts of strange experiences can occur in such a state.\n",
      "Many people have, for example, claimed to have been abducted and\n",
      "medically examined by aliens.3 This otherwise inexplicable nighttime\n",
      "phenomenon (barring the existence of curious and surgically inclined\n",
      "extraterrestrials) has been blamed on this condition of immobility\n",
      "and the often bizarre and frightening fantasies that accompany it.4\n",
      "He was quite bright, literate, and curious, so I gave him a book called\n",
      "The Terror That Comes in the Night,5 which illuminates the strange\n",
      "phenomena that can accompany sleep paralysis. The author, David\n",
      "Hufford, describes the night terror his title refers to as a variant of\n",
      "the “Old Hag” experience (a term from folklore). Those who have had\n",
      "such an experience (up to 15 percent of the population) describe fear\n",
      "and paralysis, sensations of suffocation, and encounters with malign\n",
      "entities. My client read the book, but told me that he did not believe\n",
      "what Hufford described accurately characterized her experience. He\n",
      "felt the same way about the sleep paralysis hypothesis more\n",
      "generally. For one thing, the convulsions occurred before he fell\n",
      "asleep; second, he did not experience the inability to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "I learned much more about him as we continued to get to know\n",
      "one another. I learned, for example, that he had studied history as an\n",
      "undergraduate, and had completed his degree. I learned that his\n",
      "parents had been exceptionally strict with him through his childhood\n",
      "and teenage years. They never allowed him to stay overnight at his\n",
      "friends’ houses, and they monitored his behavior very closely until he\n",
      "escaped to university. He also related a fair bit more about the fight\n",
      "that occurred immediately before the breakup of his last\n",
      "relationship. He had returned with his boyfriend to their shared\n",
      "apartment after having a few drinks and arguing in public. At home,\n",
      "the fight escalated to physical conflict. They began pushing each\n",
      "other around, with increasing violence. After one particularly\n",
      "aggressive shove, my client fell to the living room floor. While lying\n",
      "there, he swept his boyfriend’s feet out from underneath him. Then\n",
      "my client picked himself up off the floor and headed for the door. He\n",
      "returned several days later when he knew he would not be at home to\n",
      "\n",
      "\fpack up his belongings and move. That was the end of their existence\n",
      "as a couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was an element of his personality at play in this conflict\n",
      "that was not obvious. In consequence, he was struck very deeply by\n",
      "his boyfriend’s assault. He told me while discussing this sequence of\n",
      "events that he did not believe people were capable of violence. I said,\n",
      "“What do you mean by that? You earned a history degree. You have\n",
      "obviously read about the horrors and atrocities of the human past.\n",
      "You watch the news . . .” He said that, as a matter of fact, he did not\n",
      "watch the news. “Fair enough,” I replied, “but what about everything\n",
      "you learned in university? Did not that teach you that human\n",
      "aggression is both real and exceptionally common?” He said, “I read\n",
      "the books, but I just put everything I had learned into a compartment\n",
      "and did not think any further about it.” I thought that was a striking\n",
      "answer, particularly in combination with something else he told me.\n",
      "“When I was a child,” he said, “I picked up the idea that people were\n",
      "only good. My parents taught me that adults were angels.” I asked,\n",
      "“What do you mean by that? That adults never did anything bad or\n",
      "wrong?” He said, “No, you do not understand. My parents taught me\n",
      "and my sister and brother that adults were literally God’s angels, and\n",
      "that they were only good.” I said, “You believed this?” He said that he\n",
      "had believed it deeply, partly because he had been so sheltered,\n",
      "partly because his parents had been so insistent, and partly, of\n",
      "course, because it was comforting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggested that something had to be done about his naivete. It\n",
      "was not doing him any good. He was far too old and intelligent to\n",
      "maintain faith in such a childish dream. We discussed this in detail,\n",
      "speaking about the horrific events of the twentieth century and the\n",
      "mass shootings and other terrors of the more recent past. I asked\n",
      "him to explain such occurrences, and to pay more attention to any\n",
      "examples of his own anger and hostility. However, he denied the very\n",
      "existence of the latter and could not generate any convincing\n",
      "explanations for the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I assigned him a book called Ordinary Men.6 That book\n",
      "excruciatingly details how a group of ordinary policemen from\n",
      "Germany were turned into cold-blooded executioners in Poland\n",
      "during the Nazi occupation. To call the account chilling is to say\n",
      "almost nothing. I told him with all due seriousness that he had to\n",
      "read the book as if it really happened, and more, as if he and the\n",
      "\n",
      "\fpeople he knew were capable of the same heinous acts. It was time\n",
      "for him to grow up. We had established a very solid rapport by this\n",
      "time, and when I told him that his rose-colored view of the world was\n",
      "presenting him with danger sufficient to destroy his life he took me\n",
      "seriously. The next time I saw him, a week later, he had finished the\n",
      "book. His face had hardened. He looked older and wiser. I had seen\n",
      "this happen frequently in my clinical practice when people\n",
      "incorporated the darker parts of themselves, instead of—let us say—\n",
      "compartmentalizing them. They no longer had the habitual look of\n",
      "deer caught in the headlights. They looked like people from whom\n",
      "decisions emanated, rather than people to whom things merely\n",
      "happened. Then I asked him to read The Rape of Nanking,7 about\n",
      "Japanese atrocities in China in 1937. It is a horrifying book. The\n",
      "woman who wrote it committed suicide. My client read that, too, and\n",
      "we talked about it. He emerged sadder, but wiser. His nighttime\n",
      "symptoms, however, did not abate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, his comments about adults-as-angels, claims to have\n",
      "\n",
      "compartmentalized his knowledge of evil, and the presence of the\n",
      "inexplicable convulsions had started some wheels turning in the far\n",
      "recesses of my brain. Many years earlier, I had another client (a\n",
      "young woman, as is more typically the case) who had hysterical\n",
      "epilepsy—a classic case of Freudian hysteria, where bodily symptoms\n",
      "were expressing psychological problems. She had been raised in the\n",
      "rural Midwest, in a very repressed, Victorian-like Christian\n",
      "fundamentalist atmosphere. She had one of her “seizures” in my\n",
      "office—full grand mal. The sight of it left me cold. I watched\n",
      "impassively as she thrashed and convulsed violently for several\n",
      "minutes, eyes rolled back. I did not worry. I did not feel sorry for her.\n",
      "I did not feel anything. I thought, “Why is this not affecting me? My\n",
      "client is having, by all evidence, a serious convulsive episode.” I did\n",
      "not call an ambulance. When she came out of it and sat back down,\n",
      "dazed, I told her that I had responded to her seizure neither\n",
      "physically nor emotionally as if it were real, despite its otherwise\n",
      "fully credible manifestation. Previously, after pulling similar stunts\n",
      "(consciously? unconsciously? some mixture of the two?), she had\n",
      "barely skirted consignment to a psychiatric ward. She had also risked\n",
      "a diagnosis of psychosis and prescription for the medication\n",
      "accompanying that. We had some very serious talks about what she\n",
      "was doing. I let her know that I did not buy her epilepsy—that I had\n",
      "\n",
      "\fexperienced it as false, even though it seemed quite real to her. (She\n",
      "had been tested, by the way, for epilepsy, and the results had come\n",
      "back equivocal.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, she was plausibly someone who “somatized,” or physically\n",
      "represented their psychological symptoms. Freud noted that such\n",
      "somatization was often symbolic—that the manner in which the\n",
      "physical disability or oddity manifested had some meaningful\n",
      "relationship with the trauma that had precipitated it. Her hysterical\n",
      "epilepsy appeared to originate in her ambivalence and ignorance\n",
      "about sex, a substantial degree of childish immaturity, and some\n",
      "dangerous game-playing on her part. We made a lot of progress in\n",
      "our discussions. She was far from unintelligent, and the wiser part of\n",
      "her prevailed. Her seizures came to an end, along with the equally\n",
      "dangerous drama. Even better, she avoided the psych ward and\n",
      "continued with her university career. In any case, I learned then that\n",
      "Freudian hysterics existed, because I had just worked with one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to hypothesize that my current client was suffering, in a\n",
      "similar manner, from a somatization disorder. I knew about the fight\n",
      "that had terminated his last relationship, just before the onset of his\n",
      "symptoms. Perhaps his strange movements were somehow\n",
      "associated with that event? I also knew from his own account that he\n",
      "compartmentalized—that he put things in a corner of his mind where\n",
      "he would not think about them again. I did not have much\n",
      "experience with hypnosis but knew both that people capable of\n",
      "compartmentalization tended to be highly hypnotizable, and that\n",
      "hypnosis had been used with some success (albeit many years ago)\n",
      "with somatization disorders. Freud used hypnosis to treat his\n",
      "hysterical clients, who were apparently quite numerous during the\n",
      "Victorian period, at least in the upper class, fixated as they were on\n",
      "the sexual, the theatrical, and the dramatic.8 So, I thought I might try\n",
      "hypnosis to treat my client.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I often used guided relaxation techniques on my clients,\n",
      "sitting them comfortably in their armchair in my office, asking them\n",
      "to focus on different parts of their body, from the soles of their feet,\n",
      "step by step up their legs and torso, with a brief detour down their\n",
      "arms, to the top of their head, focusing on their breathing and\n",
      "relaxing. After seven or eight minutes of the relaxation instructions, I\n",
      "would count back from ten to one, requesting after each count or two\n",
      "that they relax more deeply. It was a reasonably good, quick\n",
      "\n",
      "\ftreatment for agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. I decided to start this\n",
      "way, because hypnosis employs essentially the same technique,\n",
      "adding questions about past trauma or other relevant issues once\n",
      "relaxation had been established. Its effectiveness varies substantially\n",
      "from person to person.9 (That is why stage performers who use\n",
      "hypnosis on audience members will bring twenty people to the front\n",
      "of the theater, run through the initial hypnotic suggestions, and then\n",
      "retain only the few who are obviously responsive.) In any case, I told\n",
      "my client that I thought hypnotizing him and talking about the night\n",
      "he fought with his boyfriend might be useful. I told him why\n",
      "(suggesting that his nighttime movements might be associated with\n",
      "that event). Then I told him exactly how we were going to do it, and\n",
      "that he was free to refuse or agree. I would stop whenever he asked\n",
      "me to, if he asked; and he would remember everything when we were\n",
      "finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "He agreed to try, so I began: “Sit comfortably in your chair. Place\n",
      "your hands on the arms of the chair or in your lap—wherever you are\n",
      "most comfortable. Close your eyes. Listen carefully to the noises that\n",
      "you hear in the world around you, and then turn your attention\n",
      "inward to your breathing. Breathe in deeply. . . . Hold it. . . . Breathe\n",
      "out. Move your attention down your body from your breathing to\n",
      "your thighs, and lower legs, and feet. Let your feet rest heavily on the\n",
      "floor. Pay attention to your toes, and the soles of your feet, and your\n",
      "ankles, and remember to breathe slowly, regularly, and deeply. Let\n",
      "all the tension flow out of your feet. Do not forget to breathe slowly,\n",
      "regularly, and deeply. Pay attention to your calves, and your\n",
      "shins . . .” and so on, up the whole body. Usually.\n",
      "\n",
      "My client fell spontaneously into a deep hypnotic trance before I\n",
      "got past his feet. His head lolled heavily. I asked if he could hear me.\n",
      "“Yes,” he said, barely audibly. I had to advance my chair and put my\n",
      "ear within inches of his mouth to make out what he was saying. I\n",
      "asked him if he knew where he was. “In your office,” he said. That\n",
      "was good. I said, “We are returning to the time when you had a fight\n",
      "with your boyfriend, before you moved out. Tell me what happened.”\n",
      "He said, “We had just returned to our apartment. We had both been\n",
      "drinking. We were fighting about finances and our future at the bar.\n",
      "We both got angry. We walked through the doorway of our house—\n",
      "there.” He half gestured with his arm, although it was still mostly\n",
      "limp, like the rest of his body. I was watching his eyes dart back and\n",
      "\n",
      "\fforth, like those of someone in REM sleep, under three-quarter-\n",
      "closed lids. “I was walking backward. We were moving toward the\n",
      "living room. I pushed him. Then he pushed me back. I pushed him\n",
      "again. He pushed me backward over our coffee table and onto the\n",
      "floor. He picked up our floor lamp and held it over his head. I looked\n",
      "directly into his eyes. I had never seen an expression so hostile. I\n",
      "curled into a ball and crossed my hands over my face to protect\n",
      "myself.” He said all this very slowly, gesturing awkwardly and\n",
      "minimally all the while, pointing as if toward the area in the\n",
      "apartment he was imagining. It was uncannily as if he were reliving\n",
      "the experience in real time. I glanced at the clock. The explanation,\n",
      "preparation, relaxation, and the slow recounting had taken us up to\n",
      "the one-hour mark—our normal session duration. I said, “I do not\n",
      "want to push you too far. We are running out of time. When you are\n",
      "ready, and comfortable, you might open your eyes and wake up fully.\n",
      "We could continue next week.” But he did not respond. His head\n",
      "continued to loll forward, and his eyes kept moving. I called his\n",
      "name. No change.\n",
      "\n",
      "This worried me, quite frankly. I had never heard of someone\n",
      "failing to emerge from a trance when requested. I was not sure what\n",
      "to do. Fortunately, however, he was the last client I was seeing that\n",
      "evening, so I had some time. I thought, “Well, he is in a deep trance\n",
      "and truly immersed in this account. Maybe he needs to tell the whole\n",
      "story. Let us continue and see what happens. When he is finished\n",
      "with his account, I will try to bring him around again.” I went out to\n",
      "the hallway to speak with his waiting aunt, and informed her that we\n",
      "required a bit more time. I returned to my office and sat back down,\n",
      "near him as before. I said, “What happened then?” He replied, “The\n",
      "expression on his face—I had never seen someone look like that\n",
      "before. I was forced to realize then that my boyfriend could want to\n",
      "hurt me; that one person—even if adult—could truly desire to bring\n",
      "harm to another. It was the first time I truly learned that such events\n",
      "were possible.” He began to weep, but continued his account: “I\n",
      "knocked his feet from under him, got up, and started running. He\n",
      "chased me out of the living room, down the hallway of our house,\n",
      "and through the front door. I could run faster, and got ahead of him.\n",
      "It was about four in the morning. It was still dark. I was terrified. I\n",
      "got far enough ahead of him to hide behind some nearby cars. He\n",
      "could not find me. I watched him looking for a long while. Then he\n",
      "\n",
      "\fgave up and turned around.” He was sobbing openly by this point.\n",
      "“When I was sure he was gone, I went to my mother’s place and\n",
      "stayed there. I could not believe what had happened. He might have\n",
      "killed me, and he was going to do it on purpose. I couldn’t stand it. I\n",
      "pushed it from my mind and tried never to think about it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He fell silent. I called his name. He responded. I asked him, “Do\n",

      "you know that you are in my office and sitting in the chair you\n",
      "usually occupy?” He nodded. “Are you finished telling me your\n",

      "brave of you to go through all that. Are you ready to open your eyes?”\n",
      "He said that he was. I said, “Take your time. When you are ready,\n",

      "was good for her. She was less inclined, for example, to medicate\n",
      "herself into unconsciousness and more likely to attend classes. She\n",
      "became tougher, harder, harsher—adjectives that are not always\n",
      "meant as compliments but are sometimes the precise antidote to too\n",
      "much sentimentality, which is dangerously infantilizing. We also\n",
      "made arrangements for her to spend a weekend at a local farm where\n",
      "a few common barnyard animals were kept (pigs, horses, chickens,\n",

      "fairy-tale manner appropriate to the conditions of her childhood. Her\n",
      "two-day sojourn in the country and her decision to observe the\n",
      "animals carefully helped her develop a much less romanticized\n",
      "perception of the true nature of the animals we raise and dine upon.\n",
      "They are sentient beings, in part, and we have a responsibility not to\n",
      "inflict any more suffering upon them than necessary, but they are not\n",
      "human beings, and they are certainly not children. This needs to be\n",
      "understood at an embodied level. Excess sentimentality is an illness,\n",

      "remembered them fully, and she also often became lucid—conscious\n",
      "of dreaming—while she slept. She was the only person I ever met\n",
      "who could ask her dream characters what they meant—symbolically\n",

      "outright. One day she came to me with one of her many dreams: She\n",

      "nowhere. We must confront the unknown, as such—the great Dragon\n",
      "of Chaos or the Terrible Queen—and we do not know how to do it, to\n",
      "begin with. The dream serves as the first cognitive step—in the wake\n",
      "of basic emotional, motivational, and bodily reactions such as fear or\n",
      "curiosity or freezing—in transforming that unknown into actionable\n",
      "and even articulable knowledge. The dream is the birthplace of the\n",

      "listened carefully to my client’s account (remember, this was after\n",

      "she had been told the truth, and that something of the sort had to be\n",
      "done. So we discussed the consequences of her toughening up, and\n",
      "the fact that she had successfully put her hypercritical stepmother on\n",

      "to leave my memory. I had also gone to see one of the displays of\n",
      "plasticized, sculptured bodies that were so popular about a decade\n",
      "ago, and I was horrified by it. I became a psychologist, not a surgeon\n",
      "—or, for that matter, a coroner—for a reason. However, this was not\n",

      "awaken, and there was no way I was going to let my wishes or lack\n",
      "thereof interfere with whatever wisdom the dwarf who inhabited the\n",
      "deep forest of her unconscious mind was about to impart. I told her I\n",
      "would see what I could do. It all turned out to be much simpler to\n",
      "arrange than I expected. I simply picked up the phone and called a\n",

      "I suppose he had seen his fair share of people grieving and\n",
      "frightened, and was accustomed to dealing with them calmly and\n",

      "be, and that he took heart from that. That made sense to both of us,\n",
      "and helped us understand how he could continue with his work, day\n",
      "in and out. After the tour, we went to the embalming room. It was a\n",
      "small space, perhaps a hundred feet square. The naked body of an\n",

      "provide us both with some distance, my client, her friend, and I took\n",
      "our places in the hallway immediately outside the door and observed\n",

      "some sense all the more horribly for that, because of their mundane\n",

      "proceedings, and by the time a quarter of an hour had passed, she\n",
      "was spending far more time observing than looking away. I could\n",
      "see, however, that she had taken her friend’s hand, and was gripping\n",

      "\n",
      "She was seeing firsthand that something she had believed would\n",

      "terrify her (and reasonably so) was not in fact doing so. She could\n",
      "manage the experience. She did not panic, become ill, run away, or\n",
      "even cry. She asked the mortician if she could put a hand on the\n",
      "body. He offered her a rubber glove, which she pulled on. She walked\n",
      "directly into the operating station, in a quiet and meditative state,\n",
      "and placed her gloved hand on the ribs of the body, and she kept it\n",
      "there, as if it was a comfort both to her and the poor departed soul.\n",

      "from the scientific literature—excepting the hypothalamus and the spinal cord, and the cat\n",
      "can still maintain itself in relative normality, as long as its environment is reasonably\n",

      "Emotions [New York: Oxford University Press, 1998], particularly the chapter on play, 280–\n",

      "story, unless the rats meet only once. Rats live in social environments, and they interact\n",
      "with the same individuals over and over. Thus, the game, once started, continues—and the\n",
      "rules have to govern not so much the single game as the repeating one. Once dominance is\n",
      "established, the rats can play—something they do in a manner very different from genuine\n",
      "fighting (just like play fighting with a pet dog is very different from being attacked by a dog).\n",
      "Now, the larger rat could pin the smaller rat every time. However, that breaks the rules\n",
      "(really, the meta-rules: those that are observable only over the course of repeated games).\n",
      "The purpose of the repeated game is not dominance, but continuing play. This is not to say\n",
      "that the initial dominance is without significance. It matters, not least in the following\n",
      "manner: When the two rats meet a second time, they will both adopt a unique role. The\n",
      "smaller rat is now duty bound to invite his larger friend to play, and the larger rat is duty\n",
      "bound to accept the invitation. The former will jump around playfully, to indicate his intent.\n",
      "The larger rat might hang back and act cool and a bit dismissive (as is now his prerogative);\n",
      "but if he’s a decent sort he will join in the fun, as in his heart of hearts he truly wants to play.\n",
      "However—and this is the critical issue—if the larger rat does not let the smaller rat win the\n",
      "repeated wrestling matches some substantial proportion of the time (Panksepp estimated\n",
      "30 to 40 percent of the time), the smaller rat will stop exhibiting invitations to play. It is just\n",
      "not any fun for the little guy. Thus, if the larger rat dominates with power (like a bully), as\n",
      "he could, then he will lose at the highest level (the level where the fun continues for the\n",
      "longest possible time), even while he “wins” more frequently at the lower. What does this\n",

The student of wizarding is an unloved orphan, with a dusty\\ncupboard for a bedroom, and Voldemort—who might as well be\\nSatan himself—for his archenemy. Great mythologized heroes often\\ncome into the world, likewise, in the most meager of circumstances\\n(as the child of an Israelite slave, for example, or newborn in a lowly\\nmanger) and in great danger (consider the Pharaoh’s decision to slay\\nall the firstborn male babies of the Israelites, and Herod’s\\ncomparable edict, much later). But today’s beginner is tomorrow’s\\nmaster. Thus, it is necessary even for the most accomplished (but\\nwho wishes to accomplish still more) to retain identification with the\\nas yet unsuccessful; to appreciate the striving toward competence; to\\ncarefully and with true humility subordinate him or herself to the\\ncurrent game; and to develop the knowledge, self-control, and\\ndiscipline necessary to make the next move.\\n'>\n",

In the course of normal socialization, it is\\ntypical for one of these aspects to become more developed than the\\nother (as males are socialized in the male manner, to which they are\\nalso inclined biologically, and females in the female manner).\\nNonetheless, it is possible—with enough exploration, enough\\nexposure to the round chaos and the dragon—to develop both\\nelements.

I would come home and take a walk with Tammy and\\nour children, Mikhaila and Julian. I found it very difficult to remain\\npatient with them. I had too much work to do, always—or believed I\\ndid—and had disciplined myself through years of effort to focus\\ncontinually on that. If we went for a walk, I wanted to know exactly\\nwhere we were going, just how long it would take to get there, and\\nprecisely when we were going back. This is no attitude to adopt when\\ntrying to have a pleasant and reasonable time with toddlers. Not if\\nyou want to immerse yourself in the experience.

Jaak Panksepp, one of the founders of the psychological\\nsubfield called affective neuroscience and an extremely creative, courageous, and gifted\\nresearcher, spent many years analyzing the role of play in the development and socialization\\nof rats (see J. Panksepp, Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal\\nEmotions [New York: Oxford University Press, 1998], particularly the chapter on play, 280–\\n99). Rats like to play. They particularly enjoy rough-and-tumble play, particularly if they are\\nmale juvenile rats. They enjoy it so much that they will voluntarily work—pulling a lever\\nrepeatedly, say—to gain the opportunity to enter an arena where another juvenile waits to\\nplay. When two juvenile strangers meet for the first time in this situation, they size each\\nother up and then establish dominance. If one rat is only 10 percent larger than the other, he\\ncan pretty much win every physical contest, every rat wrestling match—but they still wrestle\\nto find out, and the larger rat almost inevitably pins the smaller. If you were inclined to view\\nthe establishment of hierarchy as equivalent to dominance by power, that would be game\\nover. The larger, more powerful rat won. End of story. But that is by no means the end of the\\nstory, unless the rats meet only once. Rats live in social environments, and they interact\\nwith the same individuals over and over. Thus, the game, once started, continues—and the\\nrules have to govern not so much the single game as the repeating one. Once dominance is\\nestablished, the rats can play—something they do in a manner very different from genuine\\nfighting (just like play fighting with a pet dog is very different from being attacked by a dog).\\nNow, the larger rat could pin the smaller rat every time. However, that breaks the rules\\n(really, the meta-rules: those that are observable only over the course of repeated games).\\nThe purpose of the repeated game is not dominance, but continuing play. This is not to say\\nthat the initial dominance is without significance. It matters, not least in the following\\nmanner: When the two rats meet a second time, they will both adopt a unique role. The\\nsmaller rat is now duty bound to invite his larger friend to play, and the larger rat is duty\\nbound to accept the invitation. The former will jump around playfully, to indicate his intent.\\nThe larger rat might hang back and act cool and a bit dismissive (as is now his prerogative);\\nbut if he’s a decent sort he will join in the fun, as in his heart of hearts he truly wants to play.\\nHowever—and this is the critical issue—if the larger rat does not let the smaller rat win the\\nrepeated wrestling matches some substantial proportion of the time (Panksepp estimated\\n30 to 40 percent of the time), the smaller rat will stop exhibiting invitations to play. It is just\\nnot any fun for the little guy. Thus, if the larger rat dominates with power (like a bully), as\\nhe could, then he will lose at the highest level (the level where the fun continues for the\\nlongest possible time), even while he “wins” more frequently at the lower. What does this\\nimply? Most important, that power is simply not a stable basis upon which to construct a\\nhierarchy designed to optimally govern repeated interactions. And this is not just true for\\nrats. Alpha males among at least certain primate groups are far more prosocial than their\\nlesser comrades. Power doesn’t work for them, either (see F. B. M. de Waal and M. Suchak,\\n“Prosocial Primates: Selfish and Unselfish Motivations,” Philosophical Transactions of the\\nRoyal Society of London: Biological Science 365 [2010]: 2711–22.

Pennebaker of the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, and a host of colleagues working directly with him and\\nindependently, have demonstrated that writing that reduces existential uncertainty (there’s\\nno simpler general way of putting it) reduces anxiety, improves mental health, and boosts\\nimmunological function. All of these effects appear associated with a general decrease in\\ncomplexity-induced stress and the hormones—harmful in excess—consequentially\\nproduced. Pennebaker demonstrated, for example, that students who wrote for three days,\\nconsecutively, about the worst events in their lives experienced, first, a decline in mood (no\\ndoubt elicited by calling forth such memories) but significant improvement in their lot over\\nthe period of the following months. Other researchers showed similar effects when students\\nwrote about their future. Pennebaker initially assumed that it was something akin to\\nemotional expression, or catharsis (following Freud), that produced these positive effects—\\nthe opportunity to express anger or regret or sorrow—but found, as the result of a careful\\nsemantic analysis, that it was the development of a cognitive and causal understanding of\\nthe reason for the events and their significance that was curative. The effects of writing\\nabout the future seemed similar, in that the plans thereby generated reduced uncertainty\\nand put forward a simpler and more well-defined structure around what might otherwise\\nhave been the intolerably unspecified looming weeks and months ahead.

So, the fundamental idea is that the pursuit of meaning, guided by\\nMercury, messenger of the gods (the unconscious, as far as modern people are concerned),\\nwill enable the Seeker to collect what is, like gold, of the highest value.

I made the case in the Overture, in Rule I, in 12\\nRules for Life, and in Maps of Meaning that chaos tends to find its representation in\\nsymbolic form as feminine—but here I am talking about chaos, in serpentine guise. I can\\nexplain this by elaborating on my explanation about the alchemical picture we discussed\\nearlier—by reading it from the top down, however, this time. The more profound the threat\\n—the deeper the chaos—the more likely that it will represent itself as mankind’s most\\nancient enemy, the serpent. Perhaps it can be thought of like this: the unknown unknowns—\\nthose elements of being that are foreign and dangerous beyond imagination, and whose\\nmanifestation can kill or destroy psychologically—are those most likely to be represented in\\nserpentine form. Out of this domain, which is in some important sense even more\\nfundamental than sex itself, emerges the primordial feminine and masculine, although it\\nseems that the feminine nonetheless retains a more primary connection with the\\nfundamental unknowable itself. I think this has to do primarily with the absolute mystery of\\nbirth: with the relationship between the emergence of new forms from the feminine and the\\nemergence of new forms from the absolutely unknown. It is perhaps something of this sort\\nthat accounts for the primacy of the relationship between the snake in the Garden of Eden\\nand Eve, rather than between the snake and Adam. Perhaps, as well (and I am speculating\\nwildly here, trying to move beyond my ignorance, trying to account for the clear and\\nomnipresent symbolic relationship), it has forever been the case that females attract snakes\\n(as well as other dangerous predators), most particularly when they are taking care of their\\nyoung, and that the heightened danger they therefore face has burned the danger of the\\nfeminine in relationship to the serpentine forever in our imagination. This would imply that\\nthe decision to take on a relationship with a female brings with it increased exposure to the\\nterrible unknown (something that seems clearly true in the case of all the threats that are\\nfaced by children), as perhaps does the fact of being female itself. Now the female is also a\\nrejecting force (particularly among humans, where the females are very choosy maters [see,\\nfor example, Y. Bokek-Cohen, Y. Peres, and S. Kanazawa, “Rational Choice and Evolutionary\\nPsychology as Explanations for Mate Selectivity,” Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and\\nCultural Psychology 2 (2008): 42–55]). That holding of the power of ultimate rejection\\nmakes Nature in all its cruelty (and, it must be said, wisdom). Perhaps that is also a\\nnontrivial contributor to the feminine-serpent relationship.\\n'>\n",

      "too dangerous in North America. Since I had not been able to\n",
      "tolerate any decrease in dosage whatsoever—apart from the initial\n",
      "reduction, months before—the clinic placed me in a medically\n",

      "does her narrative idea signify? There are two ways of answering\n",
      "these questions (although both answers relate importantly to each\n",
      "other):\n",
      "\n",
      "First: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any\n",
      "\n",
      "game is the person who plays fair. This is because playing fair,\n",
      "\n",
      "despite the particularities of any given game, is a higher-order\n",
      "accomplishment than mere victory. Striving to play fair, in the\n",
      "ultimate sense—following the spirit of the rules, as well as the letter—\n",
      "is an indication of true personality development, predicated as it is\n",
      "on concern for true reciprocity. The Seekers of the Snitch must\n",
      "ignore the details of the game of Quidditch, of which they are still a\n",
      "part, while attempting to find and seize the Snitch, just as the player\n",
      "of a real-world game must ignore the particularities of that game\n",
      "while attending to what constitutes truly ethical play, regardless of\n",
      "what is happening on the playing field. Thus, the ethical player, like\n",
      "the Seeker, indomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst\n",
      "of complex, competing obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated\n",
      "with the winged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the\n",
      "realm of the divine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of\n",
      "good fortune. It is for this reason that the ancient symbol for\n",
      "Mercury is located at the very pinnacle (the most important location)\n",
      "of the image in question. It is an attempt to indicate what guides the\n",
      "process that the picture represents. Centuries ago, prior to the dawn\n",
      "of modern chemistry, the god Mercury represented what inspires or\n",
      "attracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit who possessed a\n",
      "person when his or her attention was drawn irresistibly to some\n",
      "person, situation, or event. Imagine that there are very complex\n",
      "processes going on in your mind unconsciously, highlighting events\n",
      "of potential worth and distinguishing them from everything else\n",
      "constantly unfolding around you. Imagine that those processes that\n",
      "distinguish value are alive, which is certainly the case, and that they\n",
      "are complex and integrated enough to be conceptualized as a\n",
      "personality. That is Mercury. The draw he exerts on our attention\n",
      "reveals itself in a sense of significance—in the sense that something\n",
      "happening around you is worth attending to, or contains something\n",
      "of value. The Seeker—in real life, as well as in Rowling’s Potter series\n",
      "and its Quidditch game—is he or she who takes that sense of\n",
      "significance more seriously than anything else. The Seeker is\n",
      "therefore the person who is playing the game that everyone else is\n",
      "playing (and who is disciplined and expert at the game), but who is\n",
      "also playing an additional, higher-order game: the pursuit of what is\n",
      "of primary significance. The Snitch (like the round chaos) can\n",
      "therefore be considered the “container” of that primary significance\n",
      "\n",
      "—that meaning—and, therefore, something revelatory when pursued\n",

      "you, do ye also to them likewise” (Luke 6:31). There is nothing more\n",
      "important than learning to strive under difficult and frustrating\n",
      "circumstances to play fair. This is what should be chased, so to\n",

      "we can neither control nor understand (try to make yourself\n",

      "them or not, you change in the process. Think, as well, of the\n",
      "traveling you have done, or of the work you have undertaken,\n",
      "whether for pleasure or necessity. In all these cases you experience\n",
      "what is new. Sometimes that is painful; sometimes it is better than\n",

      "better, tamed and therefore harnessed), this heroic principle must be\n",
      "regarded as the most important of all things that can organize and\n",
      "motivate mankind. This means, at least, that it must be continually\n",
      "acted out, which is what “regarded as important” actually means. It is\n",

      "not afraid to point out the relationship between dishonesty and\n",
      "psychopathology. Nonetheless, his ideas of self-deception suffer, in\n",

      "\n",
      "First error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission contributed\n",

      "to mental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of commission,\n",
      "listed above, that constitute repression. In doing so, he merely\n",
      "thought in the typical manner. People generally believe that actively\n",
      "doing something bad (that is the sin of commission) is, on average,\n",
      "worse than passively not doing something good (that is the sin of\n",
      "omission). Perhaps this is because there are always good things we\n",
      "are not doing; some sins of omission are therefore inevitable. In any\n",
      "case, there are still times when willful blindness nonetheless\n",
      "produces more serious catastrophes, more easily rationalized away,\n",
      "than the active or the unconscious repression of something terrible\n",
      "but understood (the latter being a sin of commission, because it is\n",
      "known). The former problem—willful blindness—occurs when you\n",
      "could come to know something but cease exploring so that you fail to\n",
      "discover something that might cause you substantial discomfort.\n",
      "Spin doctors call this self-imposed ignorance “plausible deniability,”\n",
      "which is a phrase that indicates intellectualized rationalization of the\n",
      "most pathological order. It should be noted that such blindness is\n",
      "often regarded as an outright crime. If you are a CEO, for example,\n",
      "and you suspect that your treasurer is cooking the books, and you do\n",
      "not investigate because you do not want to know, you may still be\n",
      "liable for your inaction—as is appropriate. Failing to look under the\n",
      "bed when you strongly suspect a monster is lurking there is not an\n",
      "advisable strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second error: Freud assumed that things experienced are things\n",
      "understood. In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a\n",
      "memory trace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately\n",
      "represented the past, like an objective video recording. These would\n",
      "\n",
      "be reasonable presumptions, if our experience was simply a series of\n",
      "objectively real and self-evident events transmitted through our\n",
      "senses, thought about, evaluated, and then acted upon. If this was all\n",
      "true, traumatic experience would be accurately represented in\n",
      "memory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious\n",
      "mechanisms (or conscious—but Freud presumed the former)\n",
      "because of its understood but terrible nature. However, neither\n",
      "reality nor our processing of reality is as objective or articulated as\n",
      "Freud presupposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine, for example, that you have been ignored, romantically—\n",

      "is not so much why your wife or husband is no longer attentive to\n",

      "On top of all that is the general complexity of life, complicating the\n",

      "search for clarity. Consider the question “What really happened?”\n",
      "say, in a failed marriage, divorce, and child-custody battle. The\n",

      "a diagnosis of psychosis and prescription for the medication\n",

      "most comfortable. Close your eyes. Listen carefully to the noises that\n",
      "you hear in the world around you, and then turn your attention\n",

      "“Yes,” he said, barely audibly. I had to advance my chair and put my\n",
      "ear within inches of his mouth to make out what he was saying. I\n",
      "asked him if he knew where he was. “In your office,” he said. That\n",

      "He said, “We had just returned to our apartment. We had both been\n",
      "drinking. We were fighting about finances and our future at the bar.\n",
      "We both got angry. We walked through the doorway of our house—\n",
      "there.” He half gestured with his arm, although it was still mostly\n",
      "limp, like the rest of his body. I was watching his eyes dart back and\n",
      "\n",
      "forth, like those of someone in REM sleep, under three-quarter-\n",
      "closed lids. “I was walking backward. We were moving toward the\n",

      "again. He pushed me backward over our coffee table and onto the\n",
      "floor. He picked up our floor lamp and held it over his head. I looked\n",
      "directly into his eyes. I had never seen an expression so hostile. I\n",
      "curled into a ball and crossed my hands over my face to protect\n",
      "myself.” He said all this very slowly, gesturing awkwardly and\n",
      "minimally all the while, pointing as if toward the area in the\n",
      "apartment he was imagining. It was uncannily as if he were reliving\n",
      "the experience in real time. I glanced at the clock. The explanation,\n",
      "preparation, relaxation, and the slow recounting had taken us up to\n",
      "the one-hour mark—our normal session duration. I said, “I do not\n",
      "want to push you too far. We are running out of time. When you are\n",
      "ready, and comfortable, you might open your eyes and wake up fully.\n",
      "We could continue next week.” But he did not respond. His head\n",
      "continued to loll forward, and his eyes kept moving. I called his\n",
      "name. No change.\n",
      "\n",
      "This worried me, quite frankly. I had never heard of someone\n",
      "failing to emerge from a trance when requested. I was not sure what\n",
      "to do. Fortunately, however, he was the last client I was seeing that\n",
      "evening, so I had some time. I thought, “Well, he is in a deep trance\n",

      "story. Let us continue and see what happens. When he is finished\n",
      "with his account, I will try to bring him around again.” I went out to\n",
      "the hallway to speak with his waiting aunt, and informed her that we\n",
      "required a bit more time. I returned to my office and sat back down,\n",
      "near him as before. I said, “What happened then?” He replied, “The\n",

      "before. I was forced to realize then that my boyfriend could want to\n",
      "hurt me; that one person—even if adult—could truly desire to bring\n",
      "harm to another. It was the first time I truly learned that such events\n",
      "were possible.” He began to weep, but continued his account: “I\n",
      "knocked his feet from under him, got up, and started running. He\n",
      "chased me out of the living room, down the hallway of our house,\n",
      "and through the front door. I could run faster, and got ahead of him.\n",
      "It was about four in the morning. It was still dark. I was terrified. I\n",
      "got far enough ahead of him to hide behind some nearby cars. He\n",
      "could not find me. I watched him looking for a long while. Then he\n",
      "\n",
      "gave up and turned around.” He was sobbing openly by this point.\n",
      "“When I was sure he was gone, I went to my mother’s place and\n",
      "stayed there. I could not believe what had happened. He might have\n",
      "killed me, and he was going to do it on purpose. I couldn’t stand it. I\n",
      "pushed it from my mind and tried never to think about it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He fell silent. I called his name. He responded. I asked him, “Do\n",

      "you know that you are in my office and sitting in the chair you\n",
      "usually occupy?” He nodded. “Are you finished telling me your\n",
      "story?” He replied in the affirmative. I said, “You did well. It was very\n",
      "brave of you to go through all that. Are you ready to open your eyes?”\n",
      "He said that he was. I said, “Take your time. When you are ready,\n",
      "come back fully awake, slowly. You are going to feel relaxed and well.\n",
      "You will remember everything you just told me and everything that\n",
      "happened here.” He nodded. A few moments later he opened his\n",
      "eyes. I asked him what had happened—what he remembered. He\n",
      "briefly recounted the evening’s events, including our initial\n",
      "discussion about hypnosis. I then called in his aunt and told her that\n",
      "he needed to rest at home, with someone in attendance, because the\n",
      "session had been intense. Adults were not angels, and people could\n",
      "not only hurt each other—they could desire that hurt with all their\n",
      "heart. But my client did not know what to do with such knowledge,\n",
      "sheltered as he was, deluded as he was by his parents—blind as he\n",
      "allowed himself to remain with his “compartmentalization.” This did\n",
      "not stop the inarticulate elements of his being from endeavoring to\n",
      "dramatically represent and bring toward consciousness both the fact\n",
      "of intended harm and everything more broadly evil such intent\n",
      "implied. He found himself compelled to duplicate precisely the\n",

      "The next week, my client did not show up for his session. I thought\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, God. Maybe I did him some serious damage.” However, he\n",
      "arrived on time the next week. He apologized for missing the last\n",
      "session, but said that he had become extremely upset and was in\n",
      "consequence too scrambled to attend or even to contact me. I asked\n",
      "why. He said, “The day after we last met, I was sitting in a restaurant\n",
      "downtown, and I saw my old boyfriend!” It was an uncanny\n",
      "coincidence. “It really rattled me, you know,” he continued, “but\n",
      "nothing came of it, and I calmed down in a day or two. And guess\n",
      "what?” “What?” I said. “I only had convulsions one night this week!\n",
      "\n",
      "And they only lasted a few minutes!” I said, “That is great! That is\n",
      "really great! What a relief! What do you think changed?” He said,\n",
      "“What really got to me in that fight was not our disagreement about\n",
      "what future we wanted. It was not the physical contact—the pushing\n",
      "and shoving. It was the fact that he truly wished me harm. I could see\n",
      "it in his face. His look truly terrified me. I could not handle it. But I\n",
      "can understand it better now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him if I could hypnotize him again. “You are obviously\n",
      "better,” I said, “but I want to make sure that we got everything.” He\n",
      "agreed, and we began. He fell into a trance just as easily. But this\n",
      "time, he condensed the story. He got through the whole account in\n",
      "fifteen minutes, as opposed to the ninety required previously. He had\n",
      "extracted what was important: the fact that he was in danger; the fact\n",
      "that someone wanted to hurt him; the fact that he had defended\n",
      "himself successfully—the fact that the world was a place inhabited by\n",
      "demons, so to speak, as well as angels. When I asked him to come\n",
      "out of the trance, in the same way I had before, he opened his eyes\n",
      "almost immediately, and was calm and fully aware.\n",
      "\n",
      "The change in his condition was remarkable. The next week, he\n",
      "\n",
      "said that his symptoms had disappeared completely. No more\n",
      "convulsions—and no more belief in the untarnished goodness of\n",
      "mankind. He had grown up and faced the reality of his own\n",
      "experience, as well as the nature of the world. It was something to\n",
      "see. Conscious acceptance of the presence of malevolence cured him\n",
      "of years of suffering. He now understood and admitted enough of the\n",
      "potential dangers that surrounded him to make his way in\n",
      "reasonable safety through the world. It was no longer necessary for\n",
      "what he had learned but refused to acknowledge to force itself upon\n",
      "him in its dramatic, embodied manner. He made what he now knew\n",

      "little at the beginning of our work together, but that was enough to\n",
      "start the ball rolling. Some girl at the college had developed a crush\n",
      "on him. He informed her that her romantic interest was not\n",
      "reciprocated. She became exceedingly vindictive, and set out to make\n",
      "his life hell. She spread rumors about his sexual habits. She\n",
      "encouraged some of her male friends to physically threaten him at\n",

      "unmercifully in transit to and from campus. Noting his distress, his\n",

      "torment. Unable or unwilling to tolerate the mounting peer pressure,\n",
      "the friends he had only recently made began to avoid and then\n",

      "what, if anything, made him vulnerable to the situation he found\n",
      "himself in, and what exactly had happened when he was being\n",
      "tormented by his spurned admirer. And I structured this so that he\n",
      "could write, as well as talk (more accurately, so that he could talk\n",
      "about what he was writing). My colleagues and I had developed an\n",

      "always in great detail. She not only remembered many dreams, but\n",
      "remembered them fully, and she also often became lucid—conscious\n",
      "of dreaming—while she slept. She was the only person I ever met\n",
      "who could ask her dream characters what they meant—symbolically\n",

      "nowhere. We must confront the unknown, as such—the great Dragon\n",
      "of Chaos or the Terrible Queen—and we do not know how to do it, to\n",
      "begin with. The dream serves as the first cognitive step—in the wake\n",
      "of basic emotional, motivational, and bodily reactions such as fear or\n",
      "curiosity or freezing—in transforming that unknown into actionable\n",
      "and even articulable knowledge. The dream is the birthplace of the\n",

      "profound).\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, this dream was not difficult to interpret, particularly\n",

      "listened carefully to my client’s account (remember, this was after\n",
      "the butcher shop and the farm) and asked her what we might do\n",
      "about that. I had no idea how I might arrange a visit to an actual\n",
      "slaughterhouse. I did not even know if they existed in the city we\n",
      "inhabited, and if they did, I could not imagine they would appreciate\n",
      "visitors, regardless of motivation. She was convinced, however, that\n",
      "she had been told the truth, and that something of the sort had to be\n",
      "done. So we discussed the consequences of her toughening up, and\n",
      "the fact that she had successfully put her hypercritical stepmother on\n",
      "the back burner, and left it at that for the remainder of the session,\n",
      "although she was tasked (as was I) with determining something that\n",
      "might serve as a reasonable substitute for a slaughterhouse.\n",
      "A week later, she returned for her scheduled session. She\n",

      "thereof interfere with whatever wisdom the dwarf who inhabited the\n",
      "deep forest of her unconscious mind was about to impart. I told her I\n",
      "would see what I could do. It all turned out to be much simpler to\n",
      "arrange than I expected. I simply picked up the phone and called a\n",
      "local mortician’s office. To my great surprise, he immediately agreed.\n",
      "I suppose he had seen his fair share of people grieving and\n",

      "be, and that he took heart from that. That made sense to both of us,\n",

      "in and out. After the tour, we went to the embalming room. It was a\n",
      "small space, perhaps a hundred feet square. The naked body of an\n",

      "the desire to foster their autonomy and push them out in the world,\n",
